  <p><i>IBM DeepQA Project Team</i></p>
  <p>
  <a href="https://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-alally">Adam Lally</a>
  is a Senior Technical Staff Member at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center.
  Adam is an experienced systems architect and software developer. As a member
  of the
  <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/deepqa/deepqa.shtml">DeepQA</a>
  Algorithms Team he helped develop the
  <a href="http://www.ibmwatson.com/">Watson system</a>
  architecture that gave the machine its speed. He also worked on the natural
  language processing algorithms that enable Watson to understand questions and
  categories and gather and assess evidence in natural language.</p>

  <p>Before working on Watson he was the lead software engineer for the
  Unstructured Information Management Architecture
  (<a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_projects.nsf/pages/uima.index.html">UIMA</a>)
  project, an open source platform for creating,
  integrating and deploying unstructured information management solutions.</p>

  <p><img src="images/ibmwatsonlogo.jpg" alt="IBM Watson logo" align="left">
  IBM's DeepQA project and the Watson system
  use UIMA as their principal infrastructure for assembling, scaling out and
  deploying all the analytic components.</p>

  <p>Adam received a BS in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic
  Institute in 1998 and an MS in Computer Science from Columbia University in
  2006.</p>

  <p><b>IBM Watson: Beyond Jeopardy! &mdash; <i>Abstract</i></b></p>
  <p>In 2007 IBM began a quest to push the boundaries of automated open-domain
  question answering - that is, to get a computer to understand and answer
  natural language questions over a broad range of topics by analyzing and
  learning from large volumes of text.</p>
  <p>Four years later, IBM introduced Watson, a computer system capable of
  quickly and precisely answering natural language questions with accurate
  confidence estimation.  To demonstrate this technology, IBM pitted Watson
  against the world's best Jeopardy! players in a formal Jeopardy!
  contest. Watson was victorious in an historic match that was aired on
  national television in February, 2011.</p>
  <p>Beating the best human contestants at Jeopardy! represents a major
  landmark in open-domain question answering.  The accomplishment marks just
  the beginning of a new era of computing. While deep analysis and language
  understanding techniques have a long way to go before computers can fluently
  interact and reason at human levels, Watson today offers an advanced software
  architecture and methodology that promises to leverage and rapidly advance
  decades of innovation in the field, creating opportunities in IT that we have
  only just imagined.  Watson's public performance heralds a future where
  scientists and businesspeople alike can efficiently tap into the wealth of
  knowledge buried in text and other unstructured data sources.</p>
  <p>This talk will give an overview of how Watson was built and present our
  vision for the future of the technology.</p>

  <h3><img src="images/lclarke.jpg" alt="Lori A. Clarke photo" align="right">Lori A. Clarke</h3>
  <p><i>University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Computer Science</i></p>
  <p>
  <a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu/people/clarke.html">Lori A. Clarke</a> 
  is chair the Department of Computer Science at the University of
  Massachusetts, Amherst, and co-director of the Laboratory for Advanced
  Software Engineering Research (LASER). She is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE,
  and a board member of the Computing Research Association's Committee on the
  Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W). She is a former vice chair of
  the Computing Research Association (CRA), co-chair of CRA-W, IEEE Publication
  Board member, associate editor of ACM TOPLAS and IEEE TSE, member of the CCR
  NSF advisory board, and ACM SIGSOFT chair, vice chair, secretary, and
  treasurer. Recent honors include the 2011 University of Massachusetts
  Outstanding Accomplishments in Research and Creative Activity Award, the
  2009 College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics Outstanding Faculty Service
  Award, the 2004 University of Colorado, Boulder Distinguished Engineering
  Alumni Award, and the 2002 SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award.</p>
  <p>Dr. Clarke's research is concerned with the verification of distributed
  systems and requirements engineering. Recently she has been investigating
  applying software engineering technologies to detect errors and
  vulnerabilities in complex processes in domains such as healthcare,
  scientific workflow, and digital government. She is also involved in several
  efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups in computing
  research.</p>
  
  <p><b>Program Analysis: Then and Now &mdash; <i>Abstract</i></b></p>
  <p>Program analysis techniques have played an important role in improving
  the verification and testing of software systems. In the early days of
  software engineering, the research community was very na&iuml;ve, expecting
  to find "the solution" to the software engineering crisis. Without the
  ability to conduct extensive evaluation, this often led to ideological wars.
  Increased computing power, open source systems, and more research maturity
  has led to a renaissance in program analysis research. This talk will
  overview some of the major accomplishments in program analysis that are
  feeding this revitalization, describe some of the past hurdles that
  researchers faced, and discuss some of the current impediments and
  opportunities.</p>

  <p><b>2012 Impact Award &mdash; <i>Abstract</i></b></p>
  <p>At ISSTA 2002, three Ph.D. students published the paper "Korat: Automated
  Testing Based on Java Predicates", which won one of the first ACM SIGSOFT
  Distinguished Paper awards.  This year, the paper wins the ACM SIGSOFT
  Impact Paper Award.  In this talk, we recount the motivation behind our
  research, the ideas presented in the paper, and some influence it had on
  software testing during the last ten years.  We also reflect on our
  experience of leading a research project as Ph.D. students.</p>
