<h3>Chrestomathics - Rethinking CS 1</h3>
<h4 class="raise">Jim Cohoon, Computer Science Department, University of Virginia and<br>

8:45 AM - 9:45 AM</h4>
</div>
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>We describe an effective CS1 approach for encouraging diverse students
without prior computer science experiences to pursue computing majors and
helping them succeed.  Separation of CS1 sections by prior experience level
concentrates diverse students in the inexperienced section. Within that
section we use several techniques to increase student comprehension and
participation, including an integrated lecture/lab, many small examples
and assignments, student participation, etc.  We discuss the approach and
an evaluation of its performance over a multi-year time period.</p>

<h3>The Benefits of Peer-led Team Learning in Teaching Programming</h3>
<h4 class="raise">Dr. Barbara G. Ryder, Virginia Tech University<br>10:15 - 11:15 AM</h4>
</div>
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>Peer-led team learning is a methodology that has been used in the sciences
and mathematics with success, and was recently applied to beginning computer
science courses by a consortium of eight colleges and universities under NSF
support.  Our three year experiment with this approach yielded valuable
insights on how to help students to learn concepts and ideas outside of class,
in a peer-guided group problem solving situation, that had a positive effect
for many students' class performance.  The talk will discuss the Peer-Led Team
Learning (PLTL) approach, our experiences with it, and the lessons learned from
3+ years experiences.</p>

<h3>Teaching Software Developer Skills in a Software Engineering Course</h3>
<h4 class="raise">V&aacute;clav Rajlich, Wayne State University<br>1:45 - 2:45 PM</h4>
</div>
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>This lecture reviews challenges and constraints that the instructor
of a software engineering course faces. It argues that training students
in the role of developers in a directed iterative process (DIP), where
the most common task is software change (SC), provides them a better
introduction to the software engineering discipline than more traditional
software engineering courses. In the course projects, students practice
developer skills by working on medium-sized open-source software systems,
while the instructor supplies all the remaining DIP roles. Providing a
comprehensive overview of SC phases, core topics covered include
refactoring, concept location, impact analysis, unit testing, etc.
At the end, the course briefly reviews the rest of the software engineering
discipline.</p>
<p>The results show that this organization of the course gives students a
more realistic experience than traditional software engineering courses.
The course has been taught repeatedly at Wayne State University and the
students have expressed a high level of satisfaction. The resources
required by such a course are comparable to other computer science courses.
The speaker has written a new textbook supporting this approach [Vaclav
Rajlich, <i>Software Engineering: The Current Practice</i>, CRC Press,
2011].</p>

<h3>Selecting and Managing the Use of Tools in an SE Course</h3>
<h4 class="raise">Jonathan Cook, New Mexico State University<br>3:15 - 4:15 PM</h4>
</div>
<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>With the plethora of open source tools that are available, it is a
great time to be a software engineering educator! However, selecting
tools to use in your course can be overwhelming, and then managing them
so that the students can effectively use them and so that the tools
enhance rather than detract from the educational goals of the course
can be more than one bargained for. This talk will present ideas and
principles behind the goals for integrating SE tools into the students'
course experiences, and then discuss various open source tools and
experiences in using them, with lessons learned and recommendations
for instructors on what to watch for in tools they choose to use.</p>
