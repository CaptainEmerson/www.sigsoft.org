   <h2>Call For Workshop Proposals</h2>
  </div>

  <p>FSE-20 is soliciting proposals for workshops to be held in
  conjunction with the main conference.  If you would like to
  bring together a group of researchers on a topic you consider relevant
  and exciting, you can consider submitting a workshop proposal to
  FSE. All proposals will be evaluated according to such criteria as
  relevance, anticipated level of discussion and liveliness of the
  workshop, the expected number of participants, and the organizer's
  experience in setting up a successful workshop.</p>

  <p>FSE-20 workshops aim to provide opportunities for exchanging
  views, advancing ideas, and discussing preliminary results in various
  areas of software engineering research and applications. Workshops are
  not an alternative forum for presenting full research papers.</p>

  <p><b>Workshop Proposals</b></p>
  <p>Workshop proposals must be no more than 4 pages in length.
  We suggest they be formatted in the
  <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM
  style</a> also required for FSE technical papers.  Each proposal should
  address at least the following issues:</p>
  
  <ol class="minindent">
   <li>Contact details of the organizers, including an identification of
   the main contact person.</li>
   <li>A brief (max 175 words) abstract of the goals and format of the
   workshop intended for the FSE-20 web pages.</li>
   <li>The theme, goals, and topics of the workshop, as well as a
   motivation of its relevance and timeliness, including an account of
   the workshop's history (if any).</li>
   <li>The workshop format, including desired length (1 or 2 days),
   forms of participation supported (demo, position statement, panel
   discussion, working session, ...) and plans for generating and
   stimulating discussion at the workshop.</li>
   <li><p>The paper selection procedure, including the types of papers
   permitted (demo's, short, long, position statements, ...), the
   dates for submission and notification of acceptance, names of
   proposed and confirmed program committee members, and a link to a
   preliminary workshop web site and call for papers.</p>
   <p>Specify if the workshop intends to publish its proceedings through
   the ACM digital library.  The hard deadline for camera-ready
   workshop papers to be published in the digial library is
   September 7, 2012.  The workshop dates should permit solid
   reviewing and paper completion before that.  We strongly recommend
   an initial submission date on or after June 25, 2012, which is a
   week after the notification date for FSE-20 research papers.</p></li>
   <li>Publicity plans, including a motivated assessment of the number of
   expected participants, as well as the the participant solicitation
   and selection process.  Indicate whether the workshop will be open
   or closed.</li>
   <li>Follow-up plans, explaining how the workshop results are expected
   to be used.</li>
   <li>A brief bio of each organizer, including past experience in
   workshop organization.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><b>Submissions</b></p>
  <p>In order to enable us to recognize and resolve topic conflicts and overlaps
  before the proposal submission deadline, we encourage you to communicate the
  topic of your workshop to the workshop co-chairs by e-mail as early as
  possible.</p>

  <p>Workshop proposals are to be sent by email in PDF format to
  aldrich at cs dot cmu dot edu</p>

  <p><b>Acceptance</b></p>
  <p>If a workshop's proceedings are to be published in the ACM Digital Library,
  the organizers should ensure that all authors submit their camera-ready papers
  by the required date. Papers intended to appear in the ACM Digital Library will
  be made available to all conference participants as part of the electronic FSE
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>Most workshops will be scheduled in the 3 days before the FSE-20
  conference, November 10-12.  Workshops may also be scheduled after the
  conference on November 16-17, if necessary or on request.</p>

  <p>Workshop organizers will be required to submit, within 3 months after
  the workshop, a workshop summary to be published in ACM SIGSOFT
  Software Engineering Notes.</p>

  <p><b>Important Dates</b></p>
  <ul class="minindent">
   <li>Workshop proposal submissions: April 2, 2012 (firm)</li>
   <li>Notification of acceptance: April 16, 2012</li>
  </ul>
