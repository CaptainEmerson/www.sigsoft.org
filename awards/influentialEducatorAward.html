<h1>Influential Educator Award</h1>
<p>Education is vital to the advancement of the research and practice of Software Engineering. Yet, the contributions of an educator often go unnoticed, except perhaps by those closest to the educator. The SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award is presented annually to an educator or educators who have made significant contributions to, and impact on, the field of software engineering with his or her accomplishments as a teacher, mentor, researcher (in education or learning), author, and/or policy maker. The award may be made to multiple collaborators for joint contributions, such as a co-authored text book.</p>
<p>Recipients receive a plaque engraved with their name and signed by the chair of SIGSOFT along with a $1000 honorarium. The award is presented by the SIGSOFT chair at ICSE during ICSE's award presentation session. The award recipient also receives support for travel to ICSE up to $2500 within their home continent and up to $3000 outside their home continent, including airfare, hotel, and conference registration for ICSE.</p>
<p>To submit a nomination for the award, please use the <a href="https://awards.sigsoft.org/">awards nomination portal</a>.  Nominations are normally due no later than December 15 of each year; <b>for the award to be announced at ICSE 2021, the deadline for the Influential Educator Award has been extended to January 31, 2021</b>.</p>
