       <h1>SIGSOFT Guidelines for Obtaining Cooperation Status</h1>
       <p>SIGSOFT has two types of relationships with conferences and workshops:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><a href="sponsorship.html">sponsorship</a> and</li>
        <li>cooperation.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>The primary difference between the two is that sponsorship
       implies financial risk and responsibility on the part of
       SIGSOFT, while cooperation implies none.  The following
       description of the in-cooperation relationship details SIGSOFT's
       responsibilities, the meeting's responsibilities and directions
       for applying for in-cooperation status.</p>
  
       <h2>In-cooperation Status</h2>
       <p>The requirements for SIGSOFT in-cooperation status include the
       following:</p>
     
       <ul>
        <li>The meeting must have an open call for participation and a
        clearly documented evaluation and review process.</li>
        <li>The meeting cannot be sponsored by a for-profit
        organization, although corporate support is allowed.</li>
        <li>Registration costs should be reasonable and SIGSOFT
        members should get a lower registration rate.</li>
        <li>For a new meeting, topics should be differentiable from
        topics of existing meetings.</li>
        <li>The timing of the meeting should not be too close to
        other, already scheduled, SIGSOFT-sponsored meetings.</li>
        <li>In the case of regional meetings serving a local community
        of software engineering researchers and practitioners, the
        requirements for differentiation in topics and timing may be
        relaxed.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Under in-cooperation, SIGSOFT is not financially responsible
       for the meeting.</p>

       <p>SIGSOFT encourages in-cooperation conferences and workshops
       to follow SIGSOFT policies and procedures, including the
       following:</p>

       <ul>
        <li><a href="/policies/pgmcommittee.html">SIGSOFT Policy on Program Committees</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions">ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions</a></li>
       </ul>

       <p>In-cooperation provides a number of <strong>benefits</strong>:</p>
      
       <ul>
        <li>You can use the ACM SIGSOFT name on publicity about the meeting</li>
        <li>You can advertise your event at no cost in SIGSOFT
        Software Engineering Notes (SEN).  A single full-page
        advertisement that conforms to SEN publication guidelines
        should be sent to the editor of SEN at least six weeks before
        it is to appear</li>
	<li>Your event will appear in the SIGSOFT
        <a href="/events.html">list of events</a></li>
	<li>Your event will be entered into the Call for Papers and
	Professional Calendar sections of Communications of the ACM
	(<a href="http://www.acm.org/cacm/">CACM</a>) and the ACM
        <a href="http://campus.acm.org/calendar/">conference calendar</a>
	web site</li>
	<li>A special rate is available for purchase of an advertisement in
        Communications of the ACM (<a href="http://www.acm.org/cacm/">CACM</a>).
        Discounts on ACM mailing lists are also available. Please contact the
        SIGSOFT <a href="/contact.html#program-director">Program
	Director</a> for further information.</li>
	<li>Conference papers are eligible to appear in the
        <a href="http://dl.acm.org/">ACM Digital Library</a>.</li>
	<li>SEN will reserve space for a final report summarizing the
	meeting</li>
	<li>You can obtain professional help and guidance from SIGSOFT
	and ACM Headquarters in organizing the event, including
	negotiations with hotels. (For more information, start
        <a href="/events.html#organizers">here</a>.)</li>
	<li>You can obtain advice and guidance from the SIGSOFT
	Executive Committee, if solicited, in organizing and promoting
	your event</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Conference organizers should contact
       <a href="mailto:Thompson.lauren@hq.acm.org">Lauren Thompson</a> at
       ACM Headquarters to have SIGSOFT membership materials sent
       directly to the conference location for display at the
       conference.</p>

       <p>To <strong>apply</strong> for in-cooperation status please
       fill out and submit the
       <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/incoop">ACM In-Cooperation TMRF form</a>.
