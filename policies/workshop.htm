<h1>Guidelines for organizing a SIGSOFT-Sponsored Workshop</h1>

      SIGSOFT encourages and sponsors workshops in all areas related to software 
      engineering. The general benefits of and requirements for SIGSOFT <a href="sponsorship.htm">sponsorship</a> 
      are the same as for conferences. In comparison to a conference, however, 
      a workshop is a technical meeting that: 
      <ul>
        <li>reports on work in progress, 
        <li>has a narrow focus, 
        <li>has sessions that enable interaction among workshop attendees, and 
        <li>is relatively low cost. 
      </ul>
      <p> SIGSOFT especially encourages workshops that collocate with SIGSOFT-sponsored 
        conferences. One advantage of collocation is that the budgeting process 
        is fairly simple, usually amounting to a one-page budget that can be handled 
        using email. 
      <p> To apply for sponsorship of a workshop, follow the <a
href="sponsorship.htm">sponsorship guidelines</a>. 
      <p> SIGSOFT workshops usually result in a "succeedings", which is written 
        sometime soon after the event and which serves as a public record of the 
        discussions held at the workshop. The workshop succeedings usually are 
        suitable for publication in SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes (<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigsoft/SEN/" target="_top">SEN)</a>. 
        If you wish to publish the succeedings in SEN, please contact the <a
href="../../contact.htm#SEN-editor">editor</a> at least six months in advance. 
        You can find an example <a
href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/users/alw/papers/sen0197b.pdf" target="_top">here</a> 
        of a succeedings previously published in SEN. <br>
