<h1>Guidelines for Running a SIGSOFT-Sponsored Workshop</h1>
<p>SIGSOFT encourages and sponsors workshops in all areas related to software engineering. The general benefits of and requirements for SIGSOFT <a href="sponsorship.html">sponsorship</a> are the same as for conferences. In comparison to a conference, however, a workshop is a technical meeting that:</p>
<ul>
 <li>reports on work in progress,</li>
 <li>has a narrow focus,</li>
 <li>has sessions that enable interaction among workshop attendees, and</li>
 <li>is relatively low cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>SIGSOFT especially encourages workshops that collocate with SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences. One advantage of collocation is that the budgeting process is fairly simple, usually amounting to a one-page budget that can be handled using email.</p>
<p>To apply for sponsorship of a workshop, follow the <a href="sponsorship.html">sponsorship guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>SIGSOFT workshops usually result in a "succeedings", which is written sometime soon after the event and which serves as a public record of the discussions held at the workshop. The workshop succeedings usually are suitable for publication in SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes (<a href="http://www.sigsoft.org/SEN/">SEN)</a>.  If you wish to publish the succeedings in SEN, please contact the <a href="/contact.html#SEN-editor">SEN editor</a> at least six months in advance.  Here is an <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=251844">example succeedings</a> that was published in SEN.</p>
