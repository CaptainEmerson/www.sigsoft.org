       <h1>SIGSOFT Guidelines for Obtaining Sponsorship Status</h1>

       <p>SIGSOFT seeks relationships with events that complement SIGSOFT's
       current sponsored events. Organizing your event with SIGSOFT brings
       numerous benefits to you and your event, the greatest of which
       is having the imprimatur of ACM and SIGSOFT, which sponsor
       the most prestigious conferences in all of software engineering.
       There are two types of affiliation for events that can be obtained from
       SIGSOFT:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>sponsorship; and</li>
        <li><a href="cooperation.html">cooperation</a>.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>The primary difference between the two is that sponsorship implies
       financial risk and responsibility on the part of SIGSOFT, while
       cooperation implies 
       none. Sponsorship may be joint with another organization, in which case
       the financial risk and responsibility are shared.</p>

       <h2>Benefits</h2>
       <p>Sponsorship by SIGSOFT provides a number of benefits to event organizers:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>SIGSOFT and ACM assume financial responsibility for the event:<br/>
        Without SIGSOFT assuming such responsibility, any financial loss 
        incurred by the conference -- whether due to low attendance or a 
        liability law suit -- would be the responsibility of the individuals 
        organizing the conference</li>
        <li>SIGSOFT and ACM provide professional help and guidance in organizing
        the event, including negotiations with hotels</li>
        <li>SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences may designate a number of accepted
        papers for the
        <a href="/awards/distinguishedPaperAwards.html">ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished
        Paper Award</a> for the conference</li>
        <li>A free advertisement for the event can appear in SIGSOFT Software
        Engineering Notes 
        (<a href="http://www.sigsoft.org/SEN/">SEN</a>). The
        advertisement should be sent to the 
        <a href="/contact.html#SEN-editor">editor</a> of SEN at least six
        weeks before the announcement is to appear in a non-conference issue</li>
        <li>The event will appear in the SIGSOFT 
        <a href="/events.html">list of events</a></li>
        <li>The event will be entered into the Call for papers and Professional
        Calendar sections of Communications of the ACM 
        (<a href="http://www.acm.org/cacm/">CACM</a>) and the ACM
        <a href="http://www.acm.org/sig_conferences/">conference calendar</a>
        web site</li>
        <li>A special rate is available for purchase of an advertisement in 
        Communications of the ACM
        (<a href="http://www.acm.org/cacm/">CACM</a>).
        Discounts on ACM mailing lists are also available. Please contact the
        SIGSOFT <a href="/contact.html#program-director">Program Director</a>
        for further information</li>
        <li>Conference papers are eligible to appear in the 
        <a href="http://dl.acm.org/">ACM Digital Library</a></li>
        <li>Minimization of calendar conflicts with other SIGSOFT-sponsored
        events.  This includes both submission dates and event dates.
        See below for details</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Application</h2>
       <p>To apply for sponsorship status:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Familiarize yourself with the 
	<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/">
        Conference Manual</a> and the 
	<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/conference_manual/1-2cri">
        ACM Criteria for Conference Approval</a></li>
        <li>For events not previously sponsored by SIGSOFT, please send a 
	description of the event via email to the SIGSOFT 
	<a href="/contact.html#vice-chair">Vice Chair</a>, at least 
	<b>sixteen months prior</b> to the event. The description must be in 
	<b>plain text</b> and include the following information:

         <li>the goals of the event</li>
         <li>names and affiliations of the principal organizers</li>
         <li>names and affiliations of the program/organizing committee members</li>
         <li>draft call for participation, including selection criteria for participants, if any</li>
         <li>plans for publicity</li>
         <li>plans for publication</li>
         <li>description of past versions of the event, if any, including

        <p>The request will be circulated to all members of the SIGSOFT
        <a href="/execcomm.html">Executive Committee</a> for review.
        A response to the request is usually given within two weeks.</p></li>
        <li>Fill out the 
	<a href="http://campus.acm.org/public/cms/tmrf/cms_paf.cfm">
	Preliminary Approval Form (PAF) for Sponsored Events</a>
	form and return it to the SIGSOFT
        <a href="/contact.html#program-director">Program Director</a>
        at least <b>sixteen months prior</b> to the event. In order to
        facilitate processing, electronic submission is required.</li>
        <li>Fill out the
        <a href="http://www.acm.org/sig_volunteer_info/conference_manual/sponstmrfpage.htm">Technical Meeting Request Form</a>
        (TMRF) for Sponsored Events and return it to the SIGSOFT
        <a href="/contact.html#program-director">Program Director</a>
        at least <b>12 months prior</b> to the event. In order to facilitate
        processing, electronic submission is required. Guidelines for 
        completion of the TMRF are available 
        <a href="http://www.acm.org/sig_volunteer_info/conference_manual/1-2-1GUIDE.HTM">here</a>.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>The SIGSOFT <a href="/execcomm.html">Executive Committee</a> is
       available to provide advice and counseling to event organizers. In
       general, we are happy to establish continuing relationships with 
       organizers of regularly held events.</p>

       <h2>Guidelines</h2>
       <p>For an event to be eligible for SIGSOFT sponsorship status, it must
       satisfy the following requirements. As part of our affiliation, SIGSOFT
       representitives will work to cooperatively fulfill them.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>A <a href="http://www.acm.org/sig_volunteer_info/conference_manual/sponstmrfpage.htm">Technical Meeting Request Form</a>
        (TMRF) must be completed and
        submitted for approval at least <b>12 months prior</b> to the event.
        The TMRF essentially establishes responsibilities and defines a budget
        for the event. (Examples of previous TMRF forms will be shared to help
	the process of bootstrapping a new event)</li>
        <li>The event must have an open call for participation. Events that
        limit attendance (e.g., a workshop) must select participants through
        an open call</li>
        <li>Registration costs should be reasonable and SIGSOFT members must
        receive the same or better discount on registration fees offered to 
        members of any other organization</li>
        <li>The Program Committee must adhere to the SIGSOFT 
	<a href="/policies/pgmcommittee.html">conflict of interest and confidentiality policy</a></li>
        <li>SIGSOFT must be mentioned in any publicity (e.g., the call for 
	participation) and publication (e.g., the proceedings) associated with
	the event. The SIGSOFT <a href="/resources/logos.html">logo image</a> must
	appear wherever other relevant graphic images appear (e.g., on fliers,
        posters, web pages, and proceedings cover pages)</li>
	<li>Authors submitting to the event must be made aware of the 
	<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">ACM
	Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism</a>, 
	and must be asked to indicate
	their understanding and acceptance of the policy and procedures.
	This can normally be done as part of the electronic submission
	process, such as through a checkbox that must be checked in order
	for the submission to be recorded</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Again, SIGSOFT representatives will work with a conference to help
       ensure a successful event.</p>

       <p><b>Choosing a Conference Date:</b> One of the benefits of SIGSOFT
       sponsorship is that we will work with a conference to help determine
       the ideal date. This includes avoiding dates that would potentially 
       conflict with similar SIGSOFT-Sponsored events, which might in turn 
       lower the number of submissions and/or attendees to your event. To this 
       end, a SIGSOFT representative, usually the SIGSOFT 
       <a href="/contact.html#vice-chair">Vice Chair</a>, will take part
       in the Steering Committee for the event to discuss potential dates and
       locations.</p>

       <p>Note that SIGSOFT, as a sponsor of the International Conference on 
       Software Engineering (ICSE), adheres to the policy adopted by the 
       <a href="http://www.icse-conferences.org/sc/">Steering Committee</a>
       that affiliation cannot be given to events that occur within a period
       beginning <i>four weeks prior to the first day of ICSE and ending four
       weeks after the last day of ICSE.</i> This policy is directed at all
       sponsors of ICSE. Exceptions to this policy are made only under rare 
       and special circumstances.</p>
      
       <p>SIGSOFT seeks to form long-lasting relationships with conferences and
       events that complement existing SIGSOFT events through their
       distinctiveness.</p>
