Developing software systems is a complex activity that involves
numerous tasks critical for a successful release. The increasing size
of systems, software maintenance, versioning and distributed global
development complicate the development; a software development
platform that integrates into the devel- opment process can automate
and simplify considerable parts of that process.  Just as important as
the technical activities of software development, are management and
communication tasks: recording pro ject events, managing pro ject
Wikis and web pages, sending out notifications, reconciling
changes, and many others. These tasks become ever more delicate with
the increas- ingly distributed nature of modern software pro jects,
small as well as large. If not handled properly they can not only
consume considerable time but also, just like bugs and other
flaws in technical tasks, cause considerable damage.  Origo is a
comprehensive platform for addressing pro ject needs by pro- viding
such facilities as pro ject web pages (both editable and generated),
forums, bug tracking etc. All the facilities are also available
through a pro- gram interface (API), allowing development tools and
environments to invoke Origo mechanisms automatically upon completion
of such specified pro ject events. An event can be the
publication of a software release, a commit into the
configuration management system, a modified Wiki page, a
posted blog or a comment left on the pro ject site; environments for
which a specific Origo plug-in already exists include
VisualStudio, Eclipse and EiffelStudio.  Internally, Origo
relies on a peer-to-peer middleware architecture support- ing the
integration of such application components as web and Wiki servers,
database servers, business logic, configuration management,
identification, access control, load balancing.  Hosted by ETH
Zurich, Origo is free to any pro ject, open-source or closed-source,
and designed for scalability. Origo Core is the underlying P2P based
application construction framework that is used to building Origo.
The framework is general and can satisfy architectural requirements
that go beyond the construction of a platform for hosting distributed
software development pro jects.  </div> </body> </html>
