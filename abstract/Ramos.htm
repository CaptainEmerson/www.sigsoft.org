<div align="justify">All too often, we pay tidy sums of money, time, and other resources to develop information technology (IT) applications that fail to satisfy their customers and users, because they fail to support the users' actions in their human organizations. As a contribution towards an eventual solution to this problem, the doctoral work reported by this thesis attempts to isolate the problem's underlying causes. This research attempts to validate two assumptions about human interaction with IT applications:

1.	The users' satisfaction with the support provided by an application to the work of their organization positively influences the perceived success of the application in their eyes.
<P>

2.	The users' satisfaction with the support provided by an application to the work of their organization is related to the support the application gives to the structural, social, political, and symbolic dimensions of the work.
<P>

The thesis describes two qualitative case studies in which the customers, users, applications, and work were observed in their organizational context. The empirical evidence gathered in these case studies validates the assumptions and brings confidence to the idea of integrating to the Requirements Engineering (RE) process the parts of organizational theory that map the structural, social, political, and symbolic dimensions of work to organizational realities.
<P>

Based on these validated assumptions, the thesis proposes a constructionist RE process that pays attention to the structural, social, political, and symbolic dimensions of work.
