To enhance applicability and encourage its use, a component or a component-based
system must have a well-designed set of interface features as well as a proper
explanation of these features.  The dual problem of designing a suitable set of
interface features in addition to properly explaining its behavior is termed the
specification design problem.  The goal of this dissertation is to identify
common properties of good specifications for use in developing high quality and
widely reusable object-based software components.  In meeting this goal, we
identify the properties of observability, controllability, and the pragmatic
criterion.
<p>
The pragmatic criterion is used for designing component interfaces and
component libraries with a suitable set of features so that they are widely
applicable, yet minimal in size, whereas observability and controllability are
used for developing the most suitable formal explanations of these components.
<p>
We define these three properties in the context of object-based software
components, and exemplify the utility of each property in the design and
explanation of a software component for ordering a collection of items. 
Additionally, we formally define observability and controllability for
object-based software components with relational behavior.  In order to validate
the properties of observability, controllability, and the pragmatic criterion,
we use them in evaluating a subset of the RESOLVE component library.  We
conclude that specifications for object-based software components that fulfill
these three properties are arguably among the most desirable in terms of
understandability and utility.
