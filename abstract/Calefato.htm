The goal of this dissertation is presenting an investigation on how to help
distributed software teams cope with the negative effects of distance and dynamism, using synchronous, text-based communication media.
Working across distances has become commonplace for teams today, mainly
because of economic factors (e.g., round-the-clock development, market proximity, access to low-cost human resources). Nevertheless, multi-site work presents considerable loss of opportunities for rich interaction, and a very substantial reduction in frequency of communication. Following the trend to business globalization, also software development has increasingly become distributed, with little or no possibility for developers to meet. Distance has a high impact especially on development process which rely heavily on the interaction, as in the requirements definition phase where stakeholders from different organizations are brought together to share information and take decisions. Among the software development activities, requirements engineering is one of the most communication-intensive, and then its effectiveness is greatly constrained by the geographical distance between stakeholders. For this reason, the need to develop a tool infrastructure to support teams of geographically dispersed stakeholders plays a key role for coping with the
lack of physical proximity when developing requirements.
The definition of requirements is a highly collaborative, interactive, and
interdisciplinary process involving heterogeneous teams of stakeholders. These
groups create temporary networks of independent companies, and collaborate as
virtual organizations, using information technology to share skills and costs. Such teams are ad hoc in that they tend to be highly dynamic in creation, participation and release, other than being geographically dispersed and cross-organizational. Hence, ad hoc teams need easy-to-setup tools, with infrastructure and administration costs kept at minimum. To provide communication support to such distributed teams, we have developed eConference, a tool for text-based, structured communication. The inceptive idea behind eConference is to reduce the need for face-to-face meetings, using a simple collaboration tool that minimizes infrastructure costs, potential technical problems, and the learning curve.
We have initially focused on studying text-based communication because
multipoint audio-video communication poses significant practical barriers to
deployment (e.g., expense, infrastructure, support), especially for short-term groups.
Rich media theories on computer-mediated communication, namely Social Presence,
Media Richness, and Common Ground, have overwhelmingly reported about the
inadequateness of text-based communication, as compared to rich media, like face-toface
or video communication. Lean media, such as email and instant messaging, lack
the ability of conveying nonverbal cues that contribute to the level of social presence (e.g., gaze, tone of voice, facial expressions), which in turns fosters individuals  motivation and mutual understanding. However, running counter to these predictions, Media Synchronicity, Time, Interaction, and Process, and Task/Technology Fit theories assert that the effectiveness of computer mediated communication depends also on contextual factors other than media richness, such as communication channel synchronicity, task typology and group temporal scope. Furthermore, Media Richness Paradox argued that the use of rich media high in social presence should be used to assure attention for small amounts of information, whereas the use of lean media low in social presence causes a decreased motivation, but increases the ability to process large amounts of information during longer periods of time. Drawing upon these theories, we argue that, by understanding the paradoxical effects of rich media high in social presence, we may be better able to select and use the most appropriate sets of
media to accomplish our goals. Thus, starting with a critical review of the very many existing, and often conflicting, theories on CMC, combined with the Task Circumplex model for task classification, we have developed a comprehensive framework for predicting, evaluating, and comparing the goodness of task-technology fits.
<p>
Providing evidence of collaborative tools effectiveness is a challenging task. An empirical study has been conducted to investigate the support that synchronous, textbased communication provides to ad hoc groups of stakeholders involved in distributed requirements elicitation and negotiations, as compared to face-to-face interaction. The findings from the study have confirmed the results of previous research, showing that, during the requirements meetings, the subjects perceived a higher level of comfort with face-to-face communication mode than with CMC, while keeping an equal level of motivation to participate. Nevertheless, the findings also show that: (1) compared to face-to-face requirements workshops, synchronous textbased workshops grant a higher opportunity to participate in a more structured, equal, and open discussion; (2) stakeholders are more satisfied with performance in synchronous, text-based elicitations than in synchronous text-based negotiations.
<p>
Overall, these results suggest to distributed teams of stakeholders that synchronous text-based elicitations represent a better task-technology fit than synchronous textbased negotiations, for reducing the negative effects of distance, as well as the need and the number of collocated requirements workshops.
