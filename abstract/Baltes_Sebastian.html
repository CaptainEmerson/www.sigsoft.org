<p>Analyzing and understanding software developers' work habits and resulting needs is an essential prerequisite to improve software development practice. In this dissertation, we utilize different qualitative and quantitative research methods to empirically investigate three underexplored aspects of software development: First, we analyze how software developers use sketches and diagrams in their daily work and derive requirements for better tool support. Then, we explore to what degree developers copy code from the popular online platform Stack Overflow without adhering to license requirements and motivate why this behavior may lead to legal issues for affected open source software projects. Finally, we describe a novel theory of software development expertise and identify factors fostering or hindering the formation of such expertise. Besides, we report on methodological implications of our research and present the open dataset SOTorrent, which supports researchers in analyzing the origin, evolution, and usage of content on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>Sketching: When we started our research, an overall picture of developers' work habits related to the creation and usage of sketches and diagrams was missing. Hence, we conducted a mixed-methods study to explore sketches and diagrams in software development practice and found that creating and using such visual artifacts are frequent tasks among software practitioners. While sketches and diagrams are often informal, study participants rated them as helpful for understanding related source code. However, they also pointed to the lack of tool support to archive sketches together with source code for later access. Participants further reported that many sketches start on analog media such as paper or whiteboards, get revised or redrawn, and then end up in a digital archive. In response to those results, we developed two tool prototypes, SketchLink and LivelySketches, to be able to better support developers' actual sketching and diagramming workflows.</p>

<p>Code Plagiarism: While the phenomenon of software developers regularly copying code snippets from Stack Overflow has been discussed, an empirical assessment of how common it is to copy such snippets without the required attribution was missing. In this dissertation, we first describe the legal situation around Stack Overflow code snippets and then give a first estimate of how frequently developers copy non-trivial snippets into public GitHub projects without the required attribution. We found that at most one quarter of the code snippets were attributed as required by Stack Overflow's CC BY-SA license. Of all GitHub projects we identified to contain code copied from Stack Overflow, only 1.8% attributed Stack Overflow as a source and used a license that is share-alike compatible with CC BY-SA. In other words, 98.2% of those projects have potential licensing conflicts. Our online surveys with developers revealed that many of them admit copying code from Stack Overflow without attribution and that they are often not aware of the licensing situation and its implications.</p>

<p>Expertise Development: Previously, there was no comprehensive theory describing the complex concept of software development expertise and its formation over time. To build such a theory, we first developed a grounded theory based on open-ended online survey answers and then embedded this theory in existing work on expertise and expert performance. To refine the resulting theory, we conducted two additional online surveys and derived implications for researchers, developers, and employers. In particular, we point to the role of monitoring, feedback, and self-reflection for expertise development and highlight their connection to the concept of deliberate practice, which has previously been described in psychology literature.</p>

<p>The common goal for all studies we conducted was to better understand software developers' work practices. Our findings support researchers and practitioners in making data-informed decisions when developing new tools or improving processes related either to the specific work habits we studied or expertise development in general.</p>
