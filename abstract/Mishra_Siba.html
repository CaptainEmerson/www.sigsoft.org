In general, these applications are the mixture of many independent, loosely coupled services with some associated operations.  The advent of new features in SOA makes the project management and testing activities associated with some uncertainties related to the characteristics of input values, because of the inadequate availability of testing data. Thus, the objective of our research work is twofold, which primarily focuses on designing and developing efficient, cost estimation and testing approaches for SOA systems. In the planning phase of software project management, the estimation of development effort is very much crucial for the organizations. Therefore, in this regard, the developed estimation techniques need to be very much efficient and should highlight all important associated cost drivers. This is because an efficient estimate for the initial phases of the development life cycle manages resources conveniently and increases the probability of projects finished in time. Further, the presence of faulty services for the SOA system under test is one of the major bottleneck in the SOA testing. Thus, for increasing the trust of the end users, it is essential to remove the faulty services during the early stage of testing. Furthermore, the thesis addresses four major problems, i.e. lack of systematic study on SOA system cost estimation, problem of imprecise effort-estimates in SOA systems, problem of uncertainties and self-adaptability, problem of distrust between the service providers and end-users. To do and achieve so, we study, analyze and examine some past developed SOA systems and based on the contextualized parameters and analysis, we design and develop some efficient approaches addressing the above mentioned identified problems. All the proposed approaches addresses the inherent complexities associated with the SOA systems. The proposed approaches presented in the thesis are evaluated using industrial data sets and case studies (based on the real-world parameters). We believe that our thesis makes a positive contribution towards providing the evidence of proper validation for cost estimation and testing approaches of SOA systems.</p></body></html>
