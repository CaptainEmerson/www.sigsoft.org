As web based-applications become increasingly important to all aspects of life, there is a need to encourage practitioners to adopt best practices so as to improve the quality of the processes in use, and therefore achieve targets related to time, budget and quality. The web development industry worldwide is dominated by a myriad of small firms. This presents a challenge in terms of determining the current practices of industry participants, and in devising improvement initiatives which are feasible for small firms. Currently, the level of adoption of best practice among web developers is unknown. To help improve the web industry, it is necessary to determine the current status of use of practices and techniques. Furthermore, the effectiveness of assessment-based software process improvement for small firms needs to be evaluated.
<p>
The objectives of this research are to understand the extent of web development practices currently in use, and to propose a software process model framework that assists the small firms in designing web based-applications so as not to run over budget and time. Concerning the quality of these applications, it is useful to guarantee the quality of these applications by applying standards models.
<p>
To achieve these objectives, an extensive literature survey of web development methodologies and software process improvement in small firms   were conducted to identify web engineering practice in web development. The literature survey clarified that, there were several development methodologies of web-based application. These studies have not taken into consideration software process improvements. However, it has concentrated on delivering functional application. Most of the studies confirmed that most of web projects run over time and budget, and as a result, the quality requirements weren't met.
<p>
Another survey used a questionnaire and interview; it was based on web engineering practices in small Jordanian firms. The questionnaire was taken from SEI. Following on from this, a detailed analysis of web engineering practices and project management issues in 20 small firms were carried out.
<p>
The survey confirmed that there is wide variation in the extent of adoption of web development best practice in terms of the individual practices, as well as the firms.
<p>
While tools and technology are widely adopted, the project management planning, customer involvement practices, Standards and Procedures, Web Metrics, and the Control of the Development Process are barely used by the firms that responded to the survey.
<p>
A software process framework for internet development in small firms is proposed in this thesis. This framework contains several steps to follow; the first step is to begin with small web project. The second step is adopt the modified XP process model which is  also a suggested process model for internet development in small firms, then apply XXPM as a quality model for software process improvement. If the proposed software process framework is to be successful then it must be laid on web engineering practices.
<p>
The study indicates that small firms can benefit from the proposed framework if they apply the web engineering practices in good manner. The outcomes from this research have the potential to better equip practitioners and consultants to undertake software process improvement, hence increasing the success of small web development firms in domestic and global markets.
