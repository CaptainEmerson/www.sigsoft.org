This dissertation presents an empirical method for developing reading
techniques that give effective, procedural guidance to software
practitioners.  Each reading technique is tailored so that it can be
used to accomplish a specific software-related task (e.g. defect
detection) using a specific kind of software document
(e.g. requirements).  This empirical method can be followed to create
and then continually improve reading techniques, since it explicitly
builds and tests underlying models of: 

<ul> <li>Specific tasks for which the document will be used
<li>Aspects of the document that must be understood to support those
tasks <li>Aspects of the environment in which the reading technique
will be used.  </ul>

This empirical approach avoids the mistake of applying assumptions
that are true in other environments to a context in which they have
not been tested.  The empirical development method is illustrated
through a discussion of how it was used to create two families of
reading techniques.  The first, Perspective-Based Reading (PBR), is
tailored for defect detection in requirements.  An experimental
evaluation of this family determined that PBR can improve the number
of defects found by both individuals and teams in certain contexts. A
second family of reading techniques, Scope-Based Reading (SBR), was
the focus of another study.  This study found that one of the two
techniques in the family was effective for novices, according to our
evaluation criteria.  A comparison of the two techniques generated
several well-motivated hypotheses to guide future research in this
area.

<p>
The potential of empirical methods for improving existing reading
techniques was also demonstrated by a third study that evaluated a new
version of the PBR techniques.  The changes in the new version were
motivated by the analyses undertaken in the earlier evaluation.  The
new version was demonstrated not to be a significant improvement over
the earlier version, but this study did isolate certain variables as
important context conditions for success.

<p>
Finally, this dissertation discusses how indications from all three
studies have been used to formulate higher-level hypotheses about
reading techniques.  It discusses these hypotheses as well as
important open questions.
