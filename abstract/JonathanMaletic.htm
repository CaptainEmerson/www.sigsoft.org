The maintenance of software has been found to be the most costly part
of the software life cycle.  Little work explicitly addresses a
framework for software maintenance problems solving.  A software
maintenance methodology, the Software Service Bay, is introduced which
focuses on the different type of problem solving required in software
maintenance.  The Software Service Bay is a knowledge based
maintenance methodology analogous to the automotive service bay.
Within an automotive service bay there are many different auto
mechanic experts, each with specific knowledge on different
maintenance problem, be they transmission, brakes, engine, etc.  Each
mechanic solves problem with their domain using different knowledge,
tools, and methods.  Software maintenance is much the same way.  The
variety of problem types (perfect, corrective, etc.) lends to a
specific set knowledge, specific set of tools, and specific problem
solving methods for each type.  A set of software specialists is
described which have knowledge of the software reuse process.  These
specialists are combined into a blackboard architecture to facilitate
opportunistic problem solving for maintenance problems.
