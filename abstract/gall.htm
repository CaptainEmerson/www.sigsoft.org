The Capsule Oriented Reverse Engineering Method (COREM) is a reverse engineering method that analyzes procedural software systems, and transforms them into functionally equivalent object-oriented software systems, thereby using object-oriented application modeling techniques.
<p>
The COREM process consists of different steps: design recovery, object-oriented application modeling, object-mapping and system-transformation.
<p>
This thesis describes the object-mapping and system-transformation processes of COREM. A reverse object-oriented application model is mapped to a forward object-oriented application model. The
reverse application model is generated from the source code, whereas the forward application model is generated on the basis of the requirements analysis independently of the actual implementation of the input program. The knowledge of a so-called Reuse Engineer is introduced into this process,
because this mapping cannot be performed automatically.
<p>
It is also described how object-oriented design is used to refine the previously generated target application model and to identify further objects for the target software system.
<p>
The results of the COREM process can be used to transform the procedural input system on the source-code level into an object-oriented target implementation. This transformation step performs the
actual program transformation and results in an object-oriented implementation of an initially procedural program.
