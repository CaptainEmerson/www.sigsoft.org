Making changes to software is a difficult task. Up to 70% of the effort in 
the software process goes towards maintenance. This is mainly because programs 
have poor structure (due to poor initial design, or due to repeated ad hoc 
modifications) which makes them difficult to understand and modify. The focus 
of this thesis is duplication in source code, which is a major cause of poor 
structure in real programs. We make two contributions: (a) a
novel program-slicing-based approach for detecting duplicated fragments in 
source code, and (b) a pair of algorithms, one that works on a single selected 
fragment of code, and the other that works on a group of matching fragments, 
for making the fragment(s) easily extractable into a separate procedure.
<p>
The key, novel aspect of our duplication-detection approach is its ability to 
detect "difficult" groups of matching fragments, i.e., groups in which 
matching statements are not in the same order in all fragments, and groups 
in which non-matching statements intervene between matching statements. 
Our procedure-extraction algorithms are an advance over
previous work in this area in two ways: they employ a range of 
transformations, including code motion and duplication of predicates, to 
handle a wide variety of difficult clone groups that arise in practice; and 
they are the first, to our knowledge, to address the extraction of fragments 
that contain exiting jumps (jumps from within the region containing the 
fragment to locations outside that are not the "fall through" exit of the 
region). We present experimental results, using implementations of our 
duplication-detection algorithm and one of our extractability algorithms, 
that indicate that our approaches are effective and useful in practice.
