<p>Several companies are planning to invest, or have already invested, money, time and resources in software reuse. Through this investment, these companies expect to improve their competitiveness in the market through reduction of costs and effort, increase their productivity and improvement in the quality and reliability in the software products development.</p>
 
<p>A common problem is that the reuse approaches in the companies are usually considered as technological (environments and tools) and process adoption problem that focus on technical aspects of reuse.</p> 
 
<p>In this scenario, reuse adoption processes - or strategies, models or programs - have been deployed in the area as a facilitator for the benefits associated to software reuse. However, existing processes present some critical problems such as, are strongly related to specific technologies; demand a high initial investment; and do not define in a systematic and sufficient detailed way the activities, roles, inputs and outputs of the whole process.</p>
 
<p>Thus, this thesis proposes a reuse reference model to aid in reuse assessment and adoption process, based on the state of the art and practice of the area. This definition was based on detailed studies on the reuse adoption processes, reuse reference models and reuse capability assessment methods involving informal surveys, empirical studies and companies reports.</p>
 
<p>This thesis seeks to demonstrate that it is possible to establish, for companies wishing to adopt reuse, a more secure way and with lower risks and costs than an ad-hoc reuse strategy. In this scenario, this thesis wants to achieve the following objectives: (i) improve the performance of various aspects of development through reuse practices (cost, quality, productivity, competitiveness of the company, among others); and (ii) reduce risks in the adoption and/or improvement of a reuse program, by providing support to an incremental process.</p>
