<div align="justify">This dissertation introduces dynamic detection of program invariants,
presents techniques for detecting such invariants from traces, assesses
the techniques' efficacy, and points the way for future research.
<P>

Invariants are valuable in many aspects of program development, including
design, coding, verification, testing, optimization, and maintenance.
<P>
They also enhance programmers' understanding of data structures,
algorithms, and program operation.  Unfortunately, explicit invariants
are usually absent from programs, depriving programmers and automated
tools of their benefits.
<P>

This dissertation shows how invariants can be dynamically detected from
program traces that capture variable values at program points of
interest.  The user runs the target program over a test suite to create
the traces, and an invariant detector determines which properties and
relationships hold over both explicit variables and other expressions.
<P>
Properties that hold over the traces and also satisfy other tests, such
as being statistically justified, not being over unrelated variables, and
not being implied by other reported invariants, are reported as likely
invariants.  Like other dynamic techniques such as testing, the quality
of the output depends in part on the comprehensiveness of the test suite.
<P>
If the test suite is inadequate, then the output indicates how,
permitting its improvement.  Dynamic analysis complements static
techniques, which can be made sound but for which certain program
constructs remain beyond the state of the art.
<P>

Experiments demonstrate a number of positive qualities of dynamic invariant
detection and of a prototype implementation, Daikon.  Invariant detection
is accurate -- it rediscovers formal specifications -- and useful -- it
assists programmers in programming tasks.  It runs quickly and produces
output of modest size.  Test suites found in practice tend to be adequate
for dynamic invariant detection.
