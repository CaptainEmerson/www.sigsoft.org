Software inspection is one of the software engineering best practices for detecting and removing defects early in the development process.  However, the prevalence of manual activities and face-to-face meetings within software inspections hinders their applicability in the context of distributed software development, where software engineering activities are spread across multiple sites and even multiple countries. Requirements inspections are especially affected by geographical distance, because they heavily rely on the same-place, same-time interaction between customers and developers.
To enable effective software requirements inspections in a distributed context, other than being supported by an Internet-mediated environment, the traditional inspection process should be reorganized to reduce synchronization and coordination issues.
<p>
This thesis firstly presents a tool for remote software inspections which adopts a reorganization of the traditional inspection process. Then, it reports a family of empirical studies conducted with the tool to understand in which conditions remote requirements inspections provide benefit to improve quality as well as increase shared understanding.
Findings from this thesis allow: 1) reorganizing the inspection process by limiting the discussion stage to a subset of the whole inspection team and focusing it on defects found by only one inspector; 2) improving the inspection effectiveness by supporting inspectors during the individual defect detection stage with focused checklist-based reading as well as perspective-based reading techniques; 3) overcoming the geographical dispersion when discriminating between true defects and false positives by replacing face-to-face meetings with asynchronous discussions; 4) increasing the shared understanding during a synchronous requirements negotiation meeting with an early asynchronous discussion on defects found by inspectors during their individual stage.
