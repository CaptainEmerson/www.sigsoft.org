Some of the most dynamic systems being built today consist of
physically mobile hosts and logically mobile agents.  Such systems exhibit
frequent configuration changes and a great deal of resource variability.
Applications executing under these circumstances need to react continuously
and rapidly to changes in operating conditions and must adapt their behavior
accordingly.  Applications with these capabilities are referred to as
context-aware.  Much of the current work on context-aware computing relies on
information directly available to an application via context sensors on its
local host, e.g., user profile, host location, time of day, resource
availability, and quality of service measurements.  The work reported in this
dissertation starts by building a new perspective on context-awareness, in
which the context includes, in principle, any information available in the ad
hoc network but is restricted, in practice, to specific projections of the
overall context.  This work reports on the design and implementation of a
middleware model that brings this notion of context to the application
programmer.  Another important aspect of the software engineering process is
the ability to reason formally about the programs we create.  This
dissertation details initial steps to create formal reasoning mechanisms
dedicated to the needs of context-aware applications.  The results of this
work simplify application development in ad hoc mobile networks from a design
and implementation perspective and through formal reasoning.
