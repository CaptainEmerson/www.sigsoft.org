Software clones are considered harmful in software maintenance and
evolution. However, despite a decade of active research, there is a
marked lack of work in the detection and analysis of near-miss
software clones, those where minor to extensive modifications have
been made to the copied fragments. In this thesis, we advance the
state-of-the-art in clone detection and analysis in several
ways. First, we develop a hybrid clone detection method, called NICAD,
that can detect both exact and near-miss clones with high precision
and recall and with reasonable performance. Second, in order to
address the decade of vagueness in clone definition, we propose an
editing taxonomy for clone creation that models developers editing
activities in the copy/pasted code in a top-down fashion. NICAD is
designed to address the different types of clones in the editing
taxonomy. Third, we have conducted a scenario-based qualitative
comparison and evaluation of all of the currently available clone
detection techniques and tools in the context of a unified conceptual
framework. Using the results of this study one can more easily choose
the right tools to meet the requirements and constraints of any
particular application, and can identify opportunities for hybridizing
different techniques. The hybrid architecture of NICAD was derived
from this study. Fourth, in order to evaluate and compare the
available tools in a realistic setting and to avoid the challenges and
huge manual effort in validating candidate clones, we have developed a
mutation based framework that automatically and efficiently measures
(and compares) the recall and precision of clone detection tools for
different fine-grained clone types of the proposed editing
taxonomy. We have evaluated NICAD using this framework and found that
it is capable of detecting different types of clones with high
precision and recall. Finally, we have conducted a large scale
empirical study of cloning in open source systems, both to evaluate
NICAD and to study the cloning characteristics of these systems in
several different dimensions. The study has demonstrated that NICAD is
capable of accurately finding both exact and near-miss function clones
even in large systems and different languages, and that there seem to
be a large number of clones in those systems.
