Embedded systems are 10 to 100 times more numerous
than traditional systems with displays and keyboards But even though
the object-oriented paradigm has been used to develop many traditional
systems, it has not been widely applied to embedded
systems. Application of the object-oriented paradigm in industry is
encouraged and reinforced by graphical methods such as the Object
Modeling Technique (OMT) and the Universal Modeling Language (UML),
but the semantics of the diagrams are not rigorous. This
research provides formal semantics for UML models in order to
build embedded systems. This formalization enables the automated
analysis of diagrams, such as simulation and model checking, which are
particularly critical for the development of embedded systems, given
the demand for specifying temporal and concurrency properties. This
research constructs homomorphisms between metamodels of the
source semi-formal language and the target formal language, so that
consistency of formalization rules can be mechanically established in
order to provide precise semantics to the semi-formal notation.
