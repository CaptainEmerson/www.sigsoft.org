These requirements are not met simultaneously by the current parsing technology. Problems with parsing became a bottleneck in our research of agile modeling. In this thesis we introduce a novel approach to specify and build parsers.</p><p>Our approach allows for expressive, tolerant and composable parsers without sacrificing performance. The approach is based on a context-sensitive extension of parsing expression grammars that allows a grammar engineer to specify complex language restrictions. To insure high parsing performance we automatically analyze a grammar definition and choose different parsing strategies for different parts of the grammar.</p><p>We show that context-sensitive parsing expression grammars allow for highly composable, tolerant and variable-grained parsers that can be easily refined. Different parsing strategies significantly insure high-performance of parsers without sacrificing expressiveness of the underlying grammars.</p></body></html>
