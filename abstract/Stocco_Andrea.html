Checking their quality and correctness is of undeniable importance. To this aim, software testing represents an excellent option, especially when supported by test automation tools, which automate the creation and replay of tests. However, research has shown that test suites produced by test automation tools are often abandoned, despite their great potential for catching regressions. One of the most subtle causes of that concern is the test suite maintenance cost as the application under test evolves. There has been very little research work directed towards helping developers to produce well-architected test suites, based on consolidated design patterns.</p><p>The use of the Page Object design pattern has proven to be very effective in the web testing environment. Page objects are fa&#231;ade classes abstracting the internals of web pages into high-level business functions that can be invoked by the test cases. Page objects enhance the maintainability and readability of a test suite, and they are often applied in the continuously changing environment of the web. Despite their utility, there have been no comprehensive approaches to aid the tester in their creation. Reverse engineering and code generation techniques can be used to help developers building more maintainable test suites, at a lower implementation cost.</p><p>This thesis presents and evaluates a novel approach for the automatic generation of page objects for web applications to support testing activities. We implemented our approach in a open-source tool called Apogen, which automatically generates Java page objects for a web application using a combination of reverse-engineering, machine learning, web-visualisation, static analysis, DOM differencing, and AST creation.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that page objects can be reverse-engineered automatically from a web application with a good degree of accuracy and completeness. Our evaluation on six open-source web applications shows that our approach is highly promising: automatically generated page object methods cover most of the applications functionalities, and result in readable and meaningful code. The implications of these results are that a considerable amount of code can be generated automatically instead of being manually written, saving precious testing time and resources. This can greatly support developers in the creation of more maintainable web test suites.</p></body></html>
