 In this dissertation we propose an expressive architectural language
in which to describe software architectures and their mapping to some
software implementation. The language supports the declaration of
multiple architectures called architectural views on the same software
system.  Each such views focuses on a different aspect of the
structure of that system. In addition to this architectural language
we propose an algorithm which reasons about the descriptions in the
architectural language to automatically check conformance of the
implementation of some software system to its architectural views. The
approach we adopt is a logic meta-programming approach.  I.e., we
express both the architectural language and the conformance checking
algorithm in a logic programming language which is used as a
meta-programming language to reason about implementation artifacts in
some (object-oriented) base language.
