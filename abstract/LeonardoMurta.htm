The Component-based Development (CBD) paradigm provides ways for
dealing with the increasing complexity of software development. In
CBD, components are first class elements, which work as encapsulation
units and can be reused or replaced, leveraging productivity and
quality. However, components evolve overtime.  Software Configuration
Management (SCM) is a discipline for controlling the evolution of
software systems. The current SCM systems were intentionally designed
to be generic, avoiding language-specific support and directly dealing
with files. This strategy leads to lack of support to high level
architectural and design elements, used in CBD.
<p>
This work presents Odyssey-SCM, an integrated SCM infrastructure for
CBD. This infrastructure is composed by a SCM process tailored to CBD;
a customizable change control system tightly integrated with a
flexible version control system for fine-grained UML model elements; a
mechanism for establishing and evolving traceability links among high
level architectural elements and source code; a mechanism for
deploying components on demand; and a mechanism that applies
data-mining over the integrated SCM repository to discover change
traces among versioned UML model elements.
