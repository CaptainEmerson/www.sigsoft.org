<div align="justify">Despite the increasing importance of data flow analysis, today's applications in compiler optimizations and software tools still rely on traditional exhaustive analysis algorithms. Exhaustively computing data flow information, especially if interprocedural analysis is involved, is known to be costly. This dissertation develops and experimentally evaluates a new approach to interprocedural data flow analysis that is demand-driven rather than exhaustive. Demand-driven analysis reduces the time and space overhead of exhaustive algorithms by limiting the analysis effort to the collection of information that is actually needed. 
A general framework is developed for deriving demand-driven interprocedural analysis algorithms from a standard algebraic description of the data flow problem. This framework models a demand for data flow information as set of queries. A system of query propagation rules is derived that formally describes the resolution of a query. The framework includes a generic demand-driven algorithm that determines the response to a query by a polynomially bounded number of applications of these rules. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the benefits of the demand-driven approach in practice.
