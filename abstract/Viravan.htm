<div align="justify">This dissertation presdents a new debugging assistant called a Debugging Critic.  As an alternative to an automated debugging oracle, the debugging critic evaluates hypotheses about fault locations.  If it cannot confirm that the code a tthe hypothesized location contains a fault, it formulates an alternative thypothesis about the location of a faulty statement or the location of ommitted statements.  The debugging critic derives knowledge of possible locations of a fault that manifested itself under a given test case from failure symptoms.  It derives information about failure symptims from programmers' replies to its questions.  Therefore, it can operate without a line-by-line specification and a knowledge base of faults.
<P>

A prototype of our debugging critic has been implemented as an extension on an existing debugger, Spyder.  An experiment with Spyder shows that programmers debug 2-4 times faster on the average with the debugging critic than without it.  Ninety-two percent of the critic's users recommend the critic as an extension of conventional debuggers.
<P>

The research in this dissertation contributes to debugging and critic systems.  In debugging, our experiment shows that an active debugging 
assistant can effectively improve debugging performance.  Another contribution is our approach to evaluate and formulate hypotheses about fault locations, 
especially the locations of omitted statements.  In critic system, our contribution is the use of questions to present informative and non-insulting criticism.
