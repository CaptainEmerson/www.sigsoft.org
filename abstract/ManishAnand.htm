A significant problem with current I/O power management is that it is
device-centric: each device implements its own algorithm without
considering the context in which it is operating.  This dissertation
puts forth the claim that devices should adapt their power management
to their environment for fast and energy-efficient data access.  Such
adaptation can be achieved through a collaboration between users,
applications and devices in a mobile computing environment.  This
approach is called collaborative power management.
<p>
This dissertation begins by improving the power management for
individual I/O devices.  It describes the design and implementation of
self-tuning power management (STPM) for network and storage devices.
STPM provides simple interfaces that allow applications and users to
share context with device drivers and power management algorithms that
effectively utilize this external context.
<p>
The dissertation next shows how applications can improve power
management by coordinating their data access across multiple I/O
devices.  It provides the design and implementation of interfaces that
allow devices to share information about their current state and
characteristics with adaptive applications.  Adaptive applications use
this context to dynamically select an I/O device to access data for
better performance and energy-savings.  It also extends the STPM
interface to allow adaptive applications to provide passive hints
about their data access intent even when they are employing another
device for data access.  This support allows devices to adapt better
to application needs.
<p>
The final part of this dissertation describes the design and
implementation of PAN-on-Demand, a system that allows co-located
computers to collaborate with each other for better data access.
PAN-on-Demand provides an energy-efficient infrastructure that allows
co-located computers to self-organize in a wireless personal-area
network (PAN) and share data using multiple radios, such as Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi.  When applications are actively using the network,
PAN-on-Demand offers high-bandwidth, low-latency communication; when
demand is light, PAN-on-Demand adapts the network structure to
minimize energy usage.
