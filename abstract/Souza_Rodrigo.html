Not all changes are accepted in the first attempt, though. Inappropriate changes can be rejected because of problems found during code review, automated testing, or manual testing, possibly resulting in rework. Our objective is to better understand the statistical association between different types of rejection&#8212;negative code reviews, supplementary commits, reverts, and issue reopening&#8212;to characterize their impacts within a project, and to understand how they are affected by certain process changes. To this end, this thesis presents an analysis of three large open source projects developed by the Mozilla Foundation, which underwent significant changes in their process, such as the adoption of rapid releases.</p><p>Methods: To pursue our objective, we analyzed issues and source code commits from over four years of the projects&#8217; history. We computed metrics on the occurrence of multiple types of change rejection and measured the time it takes both to submit a change and to reject inappropriate changes. Furthermore, we validated our findings by discussing them with Mozilla developers.</p><p>Results: We found that techniques used in previous studies to detect inappropriate changes are imprecise; because of that, we proposed an alternative technique. We determined that inappropriate changes are a relevant, daily problem, that affects about 18% of all issues in a project. We also discovered that, under rapid releases, although the proportion of reverted commits at Mozilla increased, the reverts were performed earlier in the process.</p></body></html>
