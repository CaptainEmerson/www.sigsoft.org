<p>Code smells indicate the presence of quality problems impacting many facets of software quality such as maintainability, reliability, and testability. The presence of an excessive number of smells in a software system makes it hard to maintain and evolve. Software engineering researchers have carried out many empirical and mining studies on code smells impacting various dimensions of software development. The first aim of the thesis is to understand the characteristics of code smells, such as their occurrence frequency, and relationships such as correlation and collocation among smells arising at different granularities. Machine learning techniques offer a promising alternative to deterministic smell detection methods and provide the grounds for applying transfer-learning from one programming language to another. The thesis aims to perform an exploratory study to investigate the feasibility of detecting smells using deep learning methods without carrying out extensive feature enginee ring. Also, it explores whether transfer-learning can be employed in the smell detection context. Apart from the production source code, other sub-domains of software such as configuration code in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) paradigm and database code are also prone to maintainability issues. The next goal of the thesis is to propose a method to identify quality issues in configuration code and to carry out a maintainability analysis. Furthermore, the thesis aims to propose a method to investigate code quality of embedded SQL statements, understand the impact of quality issues in connection with properties of database and production code, and pinpoint areas where improvement in tools, processes, or methods could be proposed to keep the database quality high.</p>
