<div align="justify">A stress test methodology aimed at increasing chances of discovering faults related to network traffic in Distributed Real-Time Systems (DRTS) is presented. The technique uses the UML 2.0 model of the distributed system under test, augmented with timing information, and is based on an analysis of the control flow in sequence diagrams. It yields stress test requirements that are made of specific control flow paths along with time values indicating when to trigger them. The technique considers different types of arrival patterns (e.g., periodic and bounded) for real-time events (common to DRTSs), and generates test requirements which comply with such timing constraints. Different variants of our stress testing technique already exist (they stress different aspects of a distributed system), e.g., a variant is designed to stress test a system under test at the instant when data traffic on a network is maximal. Our technique uses Genetic Algorithms to find test requirements which!
  lead to maximum possible traffic-aware stress in a system under test. Using a real-world DRTS specification, we design and implement a prototype DRTS and describe, for that particular system, how the stress test cases are derived and executed using our methodology. The stress test results indicate that the technique is significantly more effective at detecting network traffic-related faults when compared to test cases based on an operational profile.
