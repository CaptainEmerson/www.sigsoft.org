Globalization has enforced multilingualism as the order of the
day. The multinational corporations are emerging as multilingual
community, with parent functional language and subunit functional
language concurrently used and recursively linked through information
technology. In order to meet the growing demand for multilingualism,
appropriate software has to be designed. The development of
multilingual software is driven by stakeholders of multilingual
software namely software engineers, computational linguists, language
engineers and end users.
<p>
A literature review is carried out to present the essential points of
the existing multilingual software and its development approaches.
Also, multilingual software qualities like maintainability,
reusability, understandability, adaptability and language neutrality
are derived from the existing development approaches.
<p>
Model for multilingual software is essential in the design
process. But there are no explicit models available for multilingual
software. In order to achieve this, models are mined from the existing
multilingual software and they are analyzed for the multilingual
software qualities. The mined multilingual software models have some
inadequacies and these inadequacies are analyzed using design space
approach. Based on the analysis, a new model, named as aspect based
language library model, is proposed addressing the inadequacies and
formalized using the algebraic structure.
<p>
An Architectural Reference Model for Multilingual Software (ARMMS),
which is an abstract model, is designed using the aspect-based
language library model by applying the unit operations. This reference
model exhibits the expected multilingual software qualities. ARMMS is
applied to develop a framework for the multilingual software
development. PONN, KURAL, MAYAN and PONN SMS are some of the
multilingual software designed using ARMMS. These design experiences
are stated from the architectural and multilingual perspectives.
