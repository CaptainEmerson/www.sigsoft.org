Security Requirements Engineering is an emerging field at the crossroads between Security and Software Engineering. Much research has focused on this field in the last years, spurred by the realization that security must be dealt with from the earliest phases of the software development process that cover a broader organizational perspective. Specifically, the development of secure and privacy-aware systems requires to explicitly model the goals and trust relations of stakeholders of the system which will be partially implemented by the IT system and partially by organizational procedures. Existing frameworks are often not expressive enough as they lack fundamental concepts needed in order to talk about security and privacy within an organization.
<p>
This dissertation addresses this problem. We present the SI* modeling language in order to deal with security, privacy and trust, and the Secure Tropos methodology for designing secure and privacy-aware software systems. We also present their application to industrial case studies.
<p>
The SI* modeling language proposes a set of concepts founded on the notions of permission, delegation, and trust. These concepts are formalized and are shown to support the requirements analysis process through a formal reasoning tool based on the Answer Set Programming paradigm. The Secure Tropos methodology adopts the SI* modeling language for the modeling of functional, security, privacy and trust requirements. The methodology assists system designers in securing their systems by providing them facilities for verifying the correctness of security, privacy, and trust requirements and their consistency with functional requirements and guidelines to identify appropriate protection mechanisms.
<p>
There has been a lack of the proof-of-concept ability to support enterprises in the definition of complex security policies as dictated by ISO security standards (e.g., ISO-17799) or complex national Data Protection Legislation. Many proposals presented a methodology and supplied some (toy) examples but only a handful describe complex case studies, which really copes with the complexity required, for instance, by ISO-17799 compliance. We have applied the proposed language and methodology to industrial case studies. We thus demonstrate that they are suitable to support the design and analysis of the complex requirements of real-world applications.
