<p>In the Next Generation Internet landscape, different but interconnected metaphors, such as the Internet of Services, the Internet of Things and the Internet of People, to name a few, are living together in the same ecosystem. This led to an increase of the complexity of the contexts in which modern service-based systems must operate. Indeed, these systems need to cope with open and continuously evolving environments. They are expected to operate under dynamic circumstances, where dynamism is given by changes in the operational environment, changes in the availability of resources and variations in their behavior, changes in users goals, etc. In addition, modern systems consists of autonomous and heterogeneous components that, anyhow, must cooperate in a transparent way to accomplish the system goals.</p> 
 
<p>In these settings, many approaches for self-adaptive systems providing their related methodologies and tools for the design, development and execution of systems in dynamic environments have been proposed. Adaptation, indeed, is considered a promising solution, and is still widely investigated, to release systems able to adapt and re-configure themselves to satisfy the changing conditions in a context-aware manner.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the existing approaches tend to foresee the system adaptation needs and their related solutions at design-time. In this way, even if the adaptive behavior is effectively executed at runtime, the set of possible situations in which the system might need it, has been defined at design-time. Despite their effectiveness when applied in closed environments, current approaches are inadequate for the application in the typical open environments of the Next Generation Internet landscape. To deal with resources that constantly join/leave the system together with their provided functionalities, the traditional approaches require for continuous involvement of IT and domain experts for the re-configuration of the system to accommodate it to the changes. This is notably an error-prone and time-consuming task. To increase the resilience of service-based systems to frequent changes, a new way of approaching the systems modeling and adaptation is needed.</p>

<p> In this direction, we claim that adaptivity is to be considered an intrinsic characteristic of systems rather than an exception to be handled. Differently from systems where traditional change detection and adaptation mechanisms can be used, the Next Generation Internet requires systems that are adaptive "by design".</p>

<p> In this dissertation, we propose a novel design for adaptation approach of modern service-based systems that (i) allows the designer to model the system environment by abstracting from the concrete services (and their behaviors) that operate in it; (ii) provides a methodology for the uniform modeling of autonomous and heterogeneous services that is applicable in dynamic environments; (iii) provides methods for defining abstract adaptation requirements facilitating the dynamic services interoperability on top of a shared environment, by abstracting from their concrete implementation; (iv) supports the system execution via run-time and context-aware adaptation by exploiting advanced planning techniques for the dynamic and incremental service composition; (v) provides a complete life-cycle for the continuous development and deployment of adaptive service-based systems with a huge degree of flexibility and extensibility, to handle with open and dynamic environments. </p>

<p> The central aspect of the approach lies on how the used model allows us to overcome the services heterogeneity, on the one side, and to enhance the easy integration, reuse and interoperability of their offered functionalities, on the other side. The way in which services are linked to the context model allows services relations to be easily established and new services to easily join the system, thus expanding the context. Relations, which are set up by the exchange among services of offered/required functionalities, are also the way through which services can span their knowledge on the system environment (from a local to a global view). Consequently, with our approach it is possible to handle at run-time the dynamism of both systems and environments in a completely automated way. </p>

<p>The core enablers of a comprehensive framework defined over the proposed approach, have been implemented and evaluated on a real-world scenario in the smart mobility domain. Promising evaluation results demonstrate their practical applicability. </p>

<p> In addition, Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS) are spreading in new emerging contexts, such as the shared economy trend. Modern systems are expected to handle a multitude of heterogeneous components that cooperate to accomplish collective tasks. In these settings, a first extension of our framework in the direction of CAS has also been realized and evaluated. </p>
