The dissertation presents a suite of empirical studies that investigate the effectiveness of different layout techniques for Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.  Three different layout schemes are examined.  The architectural importance of classes is used to guide each layout technique.  Architectural importance in a UML class diagram is defined by stereotype information, in this case the control, boundary and entity class stereotypes.  Stereotypes are an extension mechanism provided by the UML that allow users to define semantics for the notation.  The premise is that layout techniques for UML class diagrams significantly impact comprehension.

The experiments use traditional questionnaire-based methods as well as eye-tracking equipment to quantitatively measure the performance of subjects solving specific software maintenance tasks.  Both high-level and low-level software engineering tasks are examined.  The layout techniques are also applied to design pattern comprehension in class diagrams.  Two of the experiments are replicated using an alternate method of data collection to support and verify the findings.  In addition, the effect of identifier styles (camel case and underscore) on the readability of UML class diagrams is also examined and is viewed as complementary to layout schemes used.

The main contribution is a detailed empirical validation of a set of layout techniques with respect to a variety of software maintenance tasks.  Results indicate that layout plays a significant role in the comprehension of UML class diagrams.  In particular, there is a significant improvement in accuracy, time, and visual effort for one particular layout scheme, namely multi-cluster.  In addition, a set of quantifiable eye-tracking measures are presented that provide an objective metric to measure the visual effort for class diagram layouts.  The ultimate purpose of the research is to determine effective ways to adjust the layout of existing UML class diagrams to support program comprehension.  Based on the empirical evidence, a set of guidelines for layout adjustment is presented.
