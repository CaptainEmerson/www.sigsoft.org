<p>In this PhD dissertation we present a distributed middleware proposal for large-scale application development. Our main aim is to separate the distributed concerns of these applications, like replication, which can be integrated independently and transparently.</p>
 
<p>Our approach is based on the implementation of these concerns using the paradigm of distributed aspects. In addition, our proposal benefits from the peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and aspect-oriented programming (AOP) substrates to provide these concerns in a decentralized, decoupled, efficient, and transparent way.</p>
 
<p>Our middleware architecture is divided into two layers: a composition model and a scalable deployment platform for distributed aspects.</p>

<p>Finally, we demonstrate the viability and applicability of our model via implementation and experimentation of prototypes in real large-scale networks.</p>
