The presence of faults not only reduces the quality of the software but also increases its development cost. In the current practices of software development, usually the information on the presence of fault can only be available after the software testing phase of software development life cycle. In addition, it is an expensive and time-consuming process to test the whole system thoroughly. Software fault prediction (SFP) predicts the fault-proneness of the software prior to the testing process by using some underlying software project characteristics. A large number of software fault prediction models can be found in the literature. Most of these models have used the historical software data including the previously revealed software faults and metrics information to predict the fault-proneness of the software modules. In general, the developed fault prediction models are used to predict whether a software module is faulty or non-faulty. However, this type of fault prediction provides limited information about the fault-proneness of the software system. From the software practitioner&#8217;s perspective, sometimes it is beneficial to know the prediction on possible number of faults in various modules or modules having relatively large number of faults since it would allow her/him to identify most of the faults quickly and will help to better manage the testing efforts and resources.</p><p>One of the challenges when building fault prediction models is the selection of suitable fault prediction technique(s). A myriad of techniques has been evaluated earlier for building software fault prediction models. The results of these studies revealed that performance of different techniques varies for different software systems and none of the fault prediction technique has always provided the best performance across different software systems. Recently, some studies showed that despite having the different performance in fault prediction for different fault datasets, each technique has a sub-domain where it performs relatively better compared to the other techniques. Therefore, by using multiple techniques for building fault prediction model and integrating their outputs, an improved prediction performance can be achieved. This argument encourages the use of multiple learning techniques, also called ensemble of techniques, where a unique subset of faults can be detected by each technique and the final prediction is based on the combined decision of all techniques. However, use of ensemble methods for SFP is limited, especially, for the prediction of number of faults.</p><p>In this thesis work, we focus on the prediction of number of faults in given software modules with the specific focus on the use of multiple learning techniques. We first evaluate the prediction performance of six different fault prediction techniques for the prediction of number of faults in the given software systems. Further, we explore the use of multiple learning techniques for the prediction of number of faults. First, we present an approach that dynamically selects the best learning technique from the set of learning techniques for the prediction of number of faults in the given testing modules. Second, we explore the use of multiple learning techniques for the prediction of number of faults by generating the ensemble of these techniques. We develop both homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble methods for the prediction of number of faults. We also design linear and non-linear combination rules to combine the outputs of base learners in the ensemble methods. Finally, we develop a decision tree based recommendation system that facilitates the selection of appropriate technique(s) to build fault prediction model. To build the recommendation system, initially, we have reviewed the literature to elicit the various characteristics of the fault dataset and the appropriateness of the learning techniques for the identified characteristics. Subsequently, we have formalized our findings and built a recommendation system that helps in the selection of fault prediction techniques. Based on the findings of the works presented in the thesis, we conclude that use of multiple learning techniques for building fault prediction models helps in achieving improved fault prediction performance compared to using individual fault prediction techniques. The results of experimentations showed that presented dynamic selection approach performed accurately for the prediction of number of faults. The results of ensemble methods showed that presented ensemble methods demonstrated better performance compared to the individual participating base learners. Generally, the ensemble methods based on the non-linear combination rule have outperformed other presented ensemble methods. The evaluation of recommendation system showed that proposed recommendation system provides useful hints in the selection of the fault prediction techniques.</p></body></html>
