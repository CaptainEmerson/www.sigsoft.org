My thesis is that practical language support can be provided for
Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) for Application-Service Provision
(ASP), which is better than that provided by pre-existing languages in
that: it provides greater assistance in expressing conditions that
mitigate the risks inherent in ASP; and disputes related to agreements
expressed in this manner may be more easily resolved so as to respect
the original intent of the parties.
<p>
I support this thesis by establishing requirements for SLAs for ASP
based on an account of a typical ASP infrastructure and business
model. These identify the particular risks inherent in ASP, permit
comparisons between ASP SLA languages, and guide the development of an
abstract, extensible, domain-specific language, SLAng.
<p>
SLAng is defined using a meta-modeling approach that allows a high
degree of precision in the specification of its semantics,
traceability from SLA to language specification, and the testing of
the language and SLAs to ensure they capture the original intent of
the parties.
<p>
SLAng supports the expression of mutually-monitorable SLAs, for which
the determination of compliance depends only on events visible to both
client and provider of the service. I demonstrate that such SLAs are
the most monitorable possible in a typical ASP scenario, given current
monitoring technology, and describe an approximately-monitorable
constraint on the accuracy of evidence used to administer such SLAs.
<p>
SLAng is shown to be of practical use in a case study, evaluated
against the original requirements, and compared with pre-existing
languages. The evaluation of SLAng is enhanced using metrics developed
to assist in assessing the contribution of a domain-specific language
specification to encoding the meaning of statements in that language.
