The unified approach embodied in data flow frameworks has inspired several tool-
kits that partially automate the construction of solvers for various data flow
problem classes. Unfortunately, existing toolkits have fairly limited
application. Although most can handle both classical and more advanced analyses,
the full breadth of flow analysis forms particularly those arising in new
applications of the technique lies outside the range of any single system.
<p>
This dissertation extends and reformulates the traditional approach, in order to
support the automatic generation of solvers for multisource data flow analysis
prob- lems. In this very general class, a data flow problem is modeled by a
directed graph in which more than one type of edge may be defined and
information about the type of an edge considered along with the flow value it
carries. While this describes, roughly, all forms of flow analysis, attempts to
unify the members of the multisource family have so far held only theoretical
interest. The approach we present here thus offers a significant increase in
flexibility to existing flow analysis tools.
<p>
Our method is based on a new approach to user-level specification of data flow
problems. Existing approaches require instantiation of the four parameters of a
data flow framework: value lattice, function space, flow graph, and local
semantic func- tional. All such approaches presume a fixed global semantics, an
assumption that fails in the general multisource case. Instead, we propose a
domain-specific language, which harkens back to the earliest  flow equation
forms, allowing us to view the global abstract semantics itself as a fifth
parametric component.
<p>
We then leverage this language-theoretic view to develop a new technique for the
automatic generation of efficient solvers. There are several improvements to the
basic iterative solution strategy that exploit properties of the flow graph
model in order to discover advantageous orderings and avoid redundant
computation in the global solution. All rely on a known relationship between the
structure of the flow graph and the flow of information between nodes. To adapt
these to the multisource case, we present a new method for discovering the
information flow relation induced by arbitrary global semantic specifications.
