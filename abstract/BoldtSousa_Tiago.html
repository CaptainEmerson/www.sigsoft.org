<p>The last decade brought exponential growth in the number of active users on the Internet.  Web application giants such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook achieved a user base of billions. Software and their teams began to operate their web applications at an unprecedented scale, vastly enabled by the introduction of cloud computing by Amazon introduced in 2006, revolutionizing how professionals developed and operated their software. The dynamic allocation of hardware facilitated (ultra-)large scale applications to be attainable by any team, mostly due to the shift between CAPEX (the capital cost of ownership of traditional data centers) to OPEX (the operational cost of paying on-demand). However, along with new possibilities, cloud computing introduced new development challenges: lack of broad expertise, novel architectures, new security threats, new models of governance, and dynamic scalability are just some of the most impacting ones. Recent surveys still evidence the lack of expertise as the principal challenge for cloud development teams [Rig19].</p>
<p>In this dissertation, we research how engineers address the intricacies of designing software for the cloud. Documented practices in this domain fall in a wide range of scientific validity, with most originating from limited observation or experience, lacking empirical validation and thus being insufficient in supporting informed design decisions.  We set ourselves to identify and document successful design practices for cloud software in a way that professionals can easily employ. With such a goal in mind, we claim that:
While engineering software for the cloud, there are categories of recurring problems, which solutions converge from good design principles, that adjust to the context where they emerge. Their adoption is a consequence of (1) the awareness a team has of a problem, (2) the characteristics of the product and the company, and (3) the way these solutions relate amongst themselves.  A preliminary study describes a reference cloud architecture for a research project that supports Ambient Assisted Living. From that experience, we move to study cloud-related practices and tools with a systematic interview of 25 Portuguese startups. This initial exploration bootstrapped a catalog of potential patterns, which we empirically assess within a local startup, measuring the team's performance before and after adopting the pattern catalog. We observe improvements in operations, configurations management, and build error frequency. This preliminary study provides plausibility to pursue our hypothesis further.</p>
<p>We follow extensive literature research and experimentation to mine ten novel cloud patterns, and document them, inspired by Gamma et al. [Gam+94], and the subsequent Software Engineering pattern community. The novel patterns introduced in this dissertation are: orchestration manager, containerization, job scheduler, automated recovery, failure injection, external monitor, log aggregation, preemptive logging, service discovery, and messaging system.  We relate them into a pattern language, along with two practices already well described in the literature: infrastructure as code and automated scalability.  To understand how technology companies adopt these patterns, we employed two complementary empirical methods in industrial scenarios. The first is a case study with five local startups, relating their practices with the ones proposed in the pattern language.  During this exercise, we were able to identify additional details used to improve the pattern language. We also hypothesized that these patterns gain relevance for professionals as their product and company matures, and would expect to observe the more mature companies implementing an increased number of patterns. The second was a survey inquiring over 100 professionals about their cloud practices while querying their usage (either directly or indirectly) of the identified patterns. We relate three variables with the number of patterns adopted: product operation's strategy, the number of active monthly users, and company size. We conclude that for the three variables, the average pattern adoption increases with increased maturity in that variable, with particular relevance in the number of monthly active users, the only variable providing relevant statistical results.</p>
<p>Main future work will (1) expand the pattern language, (2) repeat our experimental research with a broader population, and (3) perform controlled experiments to further understand the impact of applying this pattern language.</p>
