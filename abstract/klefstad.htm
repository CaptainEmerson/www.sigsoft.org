<p align="justify">This dissertation presents a scheme for adding tools to 
  a programming environment so as to achieve and maintain an 
  advanced and uniform user interface throughout the environment. 
  This includes the following.</p>
<div align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li>A 'tool addition scheme' with the following properties: it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requires simple tool form, allows easy tool addition, allows easy tool composition, and achieves advanced, uniform user interface to a growing and evolving tool-set. </li>
      <li>An 'Ada shell' with the following properties: it provides a convenient user interface to tools, provides a sufficient user interface to the simple tool form, is uniformly extensible and customizable, and can provide alternate command styles (e.g., 'command-language,' 'menu-selection') to same tool-set.</li>
      <li>Three distinct command interface styles including 'command-language,' 'menu-selection,' and 'character-action.'&nbsp; Each of these interfaces may be completely automated using only the information provided by the specifications for Ada packages. </li>
      <li>An 'Ada program entering tool' with the following properties: it is complete for Ada, is uniform because it uses plain text and prefixes, greatly reduces the number of key-strokes necessary to enter Ada programs, and allows Ada to be a suitable command language.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="justify">Each of these is presented along with examples and scenarios for various interactions with the environment.&nbsp; This scheme has been 
  demonstrated by implementation of the programming environment, 
  'Arcturus,' and the Ada Shell, 'Adash.' </p>
