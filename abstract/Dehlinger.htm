Safety-critical, agent-based systems are being developed without analysis techniques to discover, analyze and verify software requirements and prevent potential hazards. Agent-oriented, software-based approaches have provided abstractions in which software developers can model and develop complex, distributed systems. Yet, the realization of agent-oriented software depends upon whether agent-based software systems can achieve reductions in development time and cost similar to other reuse-conscious software development methods. Further, agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) currently does not adequately address: (1) requirements reuse in a way that is amenable to the reduction of the development cost by utilizing reusable assets, and (2) analysis techniques to evaluate safety.
<p>
This dissertation offers our AOSE methodology, Gaia-PL (Gaia   Product Line) for multi-agent systems (MAS) to capture requirements specifications that can be easily reused. Our methodology uses a product-line perspective to promote reuse in agent-based, software systems early in the development lifecycle so that software assets can be reused throughout the development lifecycle. This can significantly reduce the development time and cost of building a MAS.
For safety-critical MAS, we present our developed reuse-oriented safety analysis methods for AOSE to allow the discovery of new safety requirements and the verification that the design satisfies the safety requirements. Product-Line Software Fault Tree Analysis (PL-SFTA) and its automated tool, PLFaultCAT, provide the technique and tool support for the safety analysis of safety-critical software product lines and allow for the identification of new safety requirements. An AOSE-adapted Software Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (SFMECA) supports the derivation of a safety analysis asset using the specifications of Gaia-PL allowing for the identification of possible hazard scenarios and the failure points. Using these assets, Bi-Directional Safety Analysis (BDSA) aids in checking the completeness of PL-SFTA and SFMECA, verifies the safety properties and strengthens the safety case when safety compliance to safety standards of the MAS is necessary.
