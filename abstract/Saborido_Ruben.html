Although energy consumption affects battery life of mobile devices and limits device use, we use them almost anywhere, all the time, and for almost everything.</p><p>With the exponential growth of the market of mobile device apps in recent years, developers have witnessed a radical change in the landscape of software development. Mobile apps introduce new challenges in software design and implementation due to the constraints of internal resources (such as battery, CPU, and memory), as well as external resources (as data usage). Thus, traditional non-functional requirements, such as functionality and maintainability, have been overshadowed by performance.</p><p>Researchers are actively investigating the role of coding practices on energy consumption. However, CPU, memory, and network usages are also important performance metrics. Although the hardware of mobile devices has considerably improved in recent years, emerging market users own low-devices and have limited access to data connection. Therefore, developers should manage resources mindfully because emerging markets own a significant share of the new users coming on-line for the first time. Thus, the performance of mobile device apps is a very important topic.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that software engineers can help reduce energy consumption by considering the energy impacts of their design and implementation decisions. But developers' decisions also have an impact on CPU, memory, and network usages. So that, developers must take into account performance when evolving the design of mobile device apps. The problem is that mobile device app developers have no support to understand the impact of their decisions on their apps performance. This problem is also true for mobile device users who install apps ignoring if there exist more efficient alternatives.</p><p>In this dissertation we help developers and users to know more about the impact of their decisions on the performance of apps they develop and consume, respectively. Thus, we want to assist developers and users in developing and choosing, respectively, efficient mobile device apps. We provide observations, techniques, and guidelines to help developers make informed decisions to improve the performance of their apps. We also propose an approach to complement mobile device app marketplaces to assist developers and users to search for efficient apps. Our contribution is a valuable step towards efficient software engineering for mobile device apps and a benefit for mobile device users who want to use efficient apps.</p></body></html>
