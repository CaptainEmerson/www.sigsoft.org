Regression testing is an expensive testing process performed on
modified software to provide confidence that the software behaves
correctly, and that modifications have not impaired its quality.
Regression testing is widely used in industry; however, it is often
performed inadequately.  As a result, software quality and reliability
can decrease over the software's lifetime.
<p>
To address this problem, researchers have spent a great deal of effort
creating and studying various methodologies for improving the
cost-effectiveness of regression testing.  To compare and assess such
methodologies, researchers relied initially on analytical approaches.
More recently, however, focus has shifted to empirical studies.
<p>
Empirical studies of regression testing techniques have greatly
expanded our understanding of techniques and the factors that affect
them, but to date, these studies have also suffered from several
limitations which limit the extent to which their results may
generalize to practice.  (1) Most studies have considered only a few
context factors (characteristics of the environment or engineering
processes that may affect technique performance).  (2) Prior studies
have calculated costs and benefits using a ``snapshot'' view in which
results are considered strictly per system version; this approach,
however, ignores the fact that methodologies may exhibit different
cost-benefit tradeoffs when assessed across entire system lifetimes
than when assessed relative to individual versions.  (3) Previous
studies have largely ignored cost-benefit tradeoffs, relying on
comparisons strictly in terms of simple benefit and cost factors,
using cost-benefit models that are naive in their handling of
important revenue and cost components, or using metrics that render
comparisons across specific types of techniques impossible.
<p>
Limitations such as these make it difficult or impossible to
accurately compare and assess regression testing methodologies
relative to practical software engineering contexts.  Moreover, they
can lead researchers and practitioners to inaccurate conclusions about
the relative cost-effectiveness of techniques in practice, or the
suitability of particular techniques to particular engineering
processes.
<p>
This dissertation addresses these limitations.  First, we surveyed the
state of the art of empirical studies of regression testing techniques
and identified problems with evaluation methods and processes, and
problems related to infrastructure required for empirical studies.
Second, we developed infrastructure to support empirical studies of
regression testing considering a wide variety of software artifacts.
Third, using the infrastructure developed in the second step, we
conducted several initial empirical studies on regression testing
techniques.  Fourth, we developed a cost-benefit model to assess the
cost-effectiveness of regression testing techniques considering system
lifetime and context factors.  Finally we conducted an empirical
study, assessing regression testing techniques using these
cost-benefit models.
<p>
Through our work, we provide several important advantages for
practitioners and researchers.  For practitioners, we provide new
practical understanding of regression test techniques.  For
researchers, we provide a new cost-benefit model that can be used to
compare and empirically evaluate regression testing techniques, and
that accounts for testing context and system lifetime factors.  We
identify problems involving infrastructure, and provide infrastructure
that can help researchers conduct various controlled experiments
considering a wide variety of software artifacts.  Finally, we provide
better understanding of empirical methodologies that can be used by
other researchers to make further progress in this area.  </div>
