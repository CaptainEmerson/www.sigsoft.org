<p>An Object Process Graph is a view on the control flow graph from the perspective of a single object. It contains the uses of the object and the paths through the control flow graph that connect these uses. Such a graph can be extracted by static or dynamic program analysis.</p>

<p>This thesis addresses dynamic extraction of Object Process Graphs and the applications of these graphs. In a first step, methods for online and offine construction of Dynamic Object Process Graphs are presented. These methods are shown to be applicable even for large and interactive programs. The second step is the further transformation and application of the extracted graphs.</p>

<p>Dynamic Object Process Graphs can be used as the basis for protocol recovery 
by transforming them to protocol automata. A comparison of the results to several traditional dynamic protocol recovery approaches demonstrates their quality. 
Another application is the visualization of Dynamic Object Process Graphs for supporting program understanding. Several case studies illustrate their potential, and a controlled experiment was performed to assess their general utility for this purpose.</p> 

<p>Altogether, this thesis shows how Dynamic Object Process Graphs can be extracted effciently and used effectively. Similar to program slicing, Object Process Graph extraction is an enabling technique with applications in many reverse engineering tasks.</p>
