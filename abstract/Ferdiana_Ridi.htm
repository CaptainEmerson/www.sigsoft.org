<p>This research was motivated by the phenomenon of the software industry that uses a distributed software development for their software solution. However, distributed development process is a complex process, and may incur high costs and involve significant resources. This is due predominantly to cross-sites communication and coordination difficulties, which have made software development an even more challenging task.</p>
<p>The need of a formal framework to solve the specified problems have been discussed in the Global Software Development process (GSD). However, the redundancy of the development effort, leads to the fact that GSD works only for enterprise software development which has to be streamlined for rapid development purposes. In this research an effort is done to create rapid distributed development framework based on the well-known agile method called eXtreme Programming and existing GSD process. The main contribution of this research is called Global eXtreme Programming (GXP). GXP contributes as a getting started guidance for IT organization to build software in a distributed manner. The research evaluation shows that the GXP gives better results for small and medium-scale projects than the GSD from the standpoint of project velocity, low defects, investment costs, and communication patterns. Therefore, the research result is that the GXP can become sufficient software engineering framework alongside GSD to support distributed software development.</p>
