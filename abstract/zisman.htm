Due to the large number of existing database systems in organisations, it is necessary to evolve from the situation where these database systems are accessed and manipulated locally and in isolation, to the case where these systems can interoperate. The database systems are generally created and administered independently, and therefore many difficulties are associated with the sharing and exchange of data. An important aspect is information discovery: the location and identification of information that is related, similar or relevant to the requested information.
<p>
The underlying principle of this thesis is to permit distributed information discovery, in a loosely integrated environment, preserving the autonomy of each database system. We therefore avoid the use of integrated global schemas and centralised structures where possible.
<p>
The thesis presents an approach for distributed information discovery and access for systems with a large number of autonomous databases. In order to assist with the distributed information discovery process, we provide an architecture which does not require an integrated schema. The architecture supports dynamic evolution of the system in terms of adding or removing databases and allows the preservation of the autonomy of the participating databases. 
<p>
A distributed algorithm to perform the discovery process is provided. The approach supports complete execution of a query: data request, database location, and data access. The data access is executed as part of the discovery process. A graphical interface is used to assist with the formulation of remote queries.
<p>
A feature of our work is to distribute the information about database contents using simple hierarchical information structures composed of special terms. The structures are held locally at each database. The terms are used to identify a group of databases potentially containing data related to a particular request. A database may contain the requested data or information about other databases that may hold the required information. In order to aid with system setup and evolution, we present a support tool which assists with the incremental construction and evolution of the hierarchical information structures.
<p>
A prototype has been developed to demonstrate and evaluate the architecture, the concurrent execution of the distributed discovery process, and the dynamic evolution of the system. An implementation of the support tool is also provided. We use a case study to illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the approach. The case study is based on a health care network in which autonomous database systems from different hospitals share and exchange data.
