<div align="justify">C++ cannot be used to implement control/data abstractions as a library
if their implementations require specialized code for each user code.
<P>
This problem limits programmers to write libraries in
two ways: it makes some kinds of useful abstractions that inherently
require such facilities impossible to implement, and it makes other
abstractions difficult to implement efficiently.
<P>

The OpenC++ MOP addresses this problem by providing libraries the
ability to pre-process a program in a context-sensitive and non-local
way.  That is, libraries can instantiate specialized code depending on
how the library is used and, if needed, substitute it for the original
user code.  The basic protocol structure of the OpenC++ MOP is based
on that of the CLOS MOP, but the OpenC++ MOP runs metaobjects only
at compile time.  This means that the OpenC++ MOP does not imply
runtime penalties caused by dispatching to metaobjects.
