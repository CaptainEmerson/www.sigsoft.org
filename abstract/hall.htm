<p align="justify">Software deployment is an evolving collection of interrelated processes such as release, install, adapt, reconfigure, update, activate, deactivate, remove, and retire.&nbsp; The connectivity of large networks, such as the Internet, is affecting how software deployment is performed.&nbsp; It is necessary to introduce new software deployment technologies that leverage this connectivity.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">The Software Dock framework presented in this thesis creates a distributed, agent-based deployment framework to support the ongoing cooperation and negotiation among software producers themselves and among software producers and software consumers.&nbsp; This deployment framework is enabled by the use of a standardized deployment schema for describing software systems, called the Deployable Software Description (DSD) format.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify">The Software Dock also employs agents to traverse between software producers and consumers in order to perform software deployment activities by interpreting the deployment descriptions&nbsp; of the software systems.&nbsp; The Software Dock infrastructure allows software producers to offer to their customers high-level deployment services that were previously not possible. <br>
