<p>This dissertation is part of the research stream efforts on providing and 
improving the software systems life cycle process models (SSLC-PMs). Such 
SSLC-PMs are proved their usefulness to guide the development of software 
systems. However, with the emergence of new development IT (e.g. 
service-oriented development tools), adaptations from current object and 
component-based SSLC-PMs are required. In this dissertation, through a 
conceptual design plus proof of concept research approach, and relying on the 
theoretical principles of MDA, RUP-SE, MBASE, and the Boehm-Turner's 
Agility-Rigor guidelines, a plausible SSLC-PM called SSEM (Systems Development 
Methodology for Service-based Software Systems) is reported. SSEM was 
validated through a panel of PhD SwE experts, an illustrative case as proof of 
concept, and an empirical pilot test with a sample of IT MSc students. 
Findings suggest a feasible free-access alternative for current developers 
faced with the real-life problem of developing service-oriented software 
systems.</p>
