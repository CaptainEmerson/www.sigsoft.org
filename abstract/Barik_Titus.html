In integrated development environments, program analysis tools provide feedback about their internal diagnostics to developers through error messages, using a variety of text and visual presentations such as error listings, tooltips, and source code underlined with red squiggles. The design of human-friendly error messages is important because error messages are the primary communication channel through which tools provide feedback to developers.</p><p>Despite the intended utility of these tools, the error messages these tools produce are cryptic, frustrating, and generally unhelpful to developers as they attempt to understand and resolve the messages. Existing approaches in programming language research have attempted to surface the internal reasoning process of program analysis tools and present these details to developers to aid their comprehension process. However, we argue that the tool-centric perspective of simply revealing details in the error message about the tools' internal algorithms is insufficient: the fundamental problem is that computational tools do not reason about the causes of an identified error in the same way as the developer who attempts to understand and reconstruct why the tool produced that particular error.</p><p>The goal of this research is to investigate these misalignments through the theoretical framework of rational reconstruction---a model for identifying rationales, or reasons, for arriving at a particular conclusion---to the domain of error messages in program analysis tools. Essentially, a rational reconstruction of an error message would present rationales to the developer from a human-centered perspective that aligns with the developers' reasoning process, irrespective of the underlying algorithm or process used by the program analysis tool to identify the error. Through rational reconstructions, we can identify how to design error messages that are most useful for developers, rather than those that are most convenient for the tool.</p><p>The thesis of this dissertation is that difficulties interpreting error messages produced by program analysis tools are a significant predictor of developers' inabilities to resolve defects, and that these difficulties interpreting error messages can be explained by framing error messages as insufficient rational reconstructions in both visual and text presentations. This dissertation advances knowledge about developer comprehension during error message tasks and defends the claims of this thesis through three studies, evaluated through the theoretical framework of rational reconstruction:</p><p>To learn how developers use error messages during their own rational reconstructions, we conducted an eye tracking study in which participants resolved common defects within the Eclipse development environment. We found that the difficulty of reading these messages is comparable to the difficulty of reading source code, that difficulty reading error messages significantly predicts participants' task performance, and that participants allocate a substantial portion of their total task to reading error messages (13%--25%).</p><p>To learn how developers construct and are aided by diagrammatic rational reconstructions, or explanatory visualizations, we conducted a usability design experiment in which developers diagrammatically annotated and explained source code listings involving compiler error messages. We found that explanatory visualizations are used intuitively by developers in their own self-explanations of error messages, and that these visualizations are significantly different from baseline visualizations in how they explicate relationships between program elements in the source code.</p><p>To learn how rational reconstructions aid developer comprehension in text presentations, we conducted a comparative evaluation between two Java compilers and investigated their error messages through Toulmin's model of argument, a form of rational reconstruction. For generalizability, we additionally conducted a study to analyze confusing error messages on Stack Overflow against human-authored reconstructions of those error messages. We also analyzed these answers using Toulmin's model of argument. We found that developers significantly preferred error messages with proper argument structures over deficient arguments, but will prefer deficient arguments if they provide a resolution to the problem. We found that human-authored explanations converge to argument structures that either offer a simple resolution, or employ a proper simple or extended argument structure.</p><p>The dissertation concludes with implications and design guidelines for practitioners who wish to improve the usability of error messages for program analysis tools. To assess and operationalize these guidelines, we developed a proof-of-concept compiler called Rational TypeScript---a modified Microsoft TypeScript compiler that presents error messages as rational reconstructions. A focus group conducted with professional software developers suggested that Rational TypeScript messages were more helpful than baseline TypeScript messages, particularly with developers who only sporadically program with TypeScript. Although full-time TypeScript developers generally preferred the brevity of baseline error messages for routine errors, they nevertheless indicated that rational reconstructions would be useful as a presentation option for error messages when working with unfamiliar code.</p></body></html>
