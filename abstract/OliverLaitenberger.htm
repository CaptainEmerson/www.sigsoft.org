The inadequate and late removal of defects continues to be a major
problem in today's software industry. One of the proposed solutions
for addressing this problem is software inspection. However, despite
the large body of inspection experience, there is still a need for
further work on the question of how to organize a single inspection
and how to provide technical support for the defect detection
activity.
<p>
This thesis presents the architecture-centric approach for inspection
organization and introduces the Perspective-based Reading (PBR)
technique to support defect detection. The results of three empirical
studies suggest that PBR in conjunction with the architecture-centric
strategy increases the cost-effectiveness of existing inspection
implementations.
