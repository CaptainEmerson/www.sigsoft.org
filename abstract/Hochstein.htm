<div align="justify">This dissertation presents an empirical approach for building and
storing knowledge about software engineering through human-subject
research. It is based on running empirical studies in stages, where
previously held hypotheses are supported or refuted in different
contexts, and new hypotheses are generated. The approach is both mixed
methods based and opportunistic, and focuses on identifying a diverse
set of potential sources for running studies. The output produced is
an experience base which contains a set of these hypotheses, the
empirical evidence which generated them, and the implications for
practitioners and researchers. This experience base is contained in a
software system which can be navigated by stakeholders to trace the
"chain of evidence" of hypotheses as they evolve over time and across
studies.
<P>

This approach has been applied to the domain of high-end computing, to build
knowledge related to programmer productivity. The methods include controlled
experiments and quasi-experiments, case studies, observational
studies, interviews, surveys, and focus groups. The results of these
studies have been stored in a proof-of-concept system that implements
the experience base.
