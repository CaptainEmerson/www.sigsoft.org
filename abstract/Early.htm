<div align="justify">This dissertation investigated possible root causes of resistance or support exerted by software development project managers on the use of formal software development processes. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the significance of correlations between independent variables representing the software development managers' perceived effects of using formal development processes on projects' cost and programmers' creativity, and the dependent variable level of resistance to the formal processes' implementation. The multiple regression analysis did not produce evidence of significant correlations between either of these factors. The study reports findings that a small degree of support for the use of formal software development processes exists among software development project managers. The findings reported also show that although software development project managers perceive benefits from the use of formal software development processes, they list perceived !
 cost as the primary reason given for resisting their use. Additional reasons listed for opposition to the use of formal software development processes include the perception of limited creativity, the perception that too much time would be required to follow a formal process, and awareness of insufficient knowledge to properly apply software engineering principles and practices.
