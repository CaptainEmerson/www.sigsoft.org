Influence is important to the morale of technical team members, to their reputations, and to the performance of teams and organizations. It has been argued that high performing teams are those in which the most competent members have the most influence. No study of technical teams has tracked the emergence of members' influence over time. This thesis examined the development of individuals' influence on their software development teams over the course of an entire project. The study used data from 491 members of 145 undergraduate software project teams.
<p>
This study showed that team members' influence in one period tended to predict
their influence in the next period and that influence changed over
time. Perceived influence increased on average, and team members increasingly
discriminated among those having more and less influence. Influence predicted
important individual outcomes peer evaluation ratings of contribution to the team, actual grades, and nominations to be future coworkers and managers.
<p>
The results gave some support to status generalization theory as grade point average and fraternity membership directly affected influence in the first period. However, the effects of other diffuse status characteristics, especially of gender and race, seem to have been more complex. The impact of specific task-relevant attributes, such as programming skill and preparation, on members' influence was larger and more consistent overall. Prior reputation was overcome by actions in the current setting.
<p>
The study also gave strong support to critical resources theory, which implies
that influence may be exchanged for providing critical resources to the
team. Specializing in programming work contributed to members'
influence. Finally, the results gave strong support to theories of informal
communication, which argue that, in interdependent work such as software
development, communication is an essential skill and task. When working with
others was evaluated along with all other factors, this behavior, along with
technical skill, tended to account for most of the variance in individual
influence. Communication was shown to be a mediator between gender, effort,
technical skill and influence, and to moderate the relationship between race
and influence. Overall, the results support a dual picture of influence in
technical teams that influence depends on individuals' technical and social contributions.
