However, some technical and non-technical obstacles still hinder its effective execution in software organizations, including the difficulty in managing and providing visibility of reuse scenarios, due to the amount and variety of associated data. This work presents APPRAiSER, an approach that aims at providing awareness through information visualization resources for supporting the execution of reuse tasks. Some needs identified through studies for characterizing the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice served as input for the definition of APPRAiSER. The approach is composed by tools for extracting, aggregating, and visualizing data from software repositories, as well as some conceptual elements for structuring the knowledge about concepts in the field. Studies conducted with professionals from academia and industry showed that the developed tool support increases awareness on the execution of reuse tasks, and the conceptual elements have the potential to help understanding the concepts for the engineering of interactive visualization tools. Finally, some improvements were also pointed out for the approach.</p></body></html>
