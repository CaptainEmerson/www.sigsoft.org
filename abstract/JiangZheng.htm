Software products are often built from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
components. When new releases of these components are made available
for integration and testing, source code is usually not provided by
the COTS vendors. Various regression test selection (RTS) techniques
have been developed and have been shown to be cost effective. However,
the majority of these test selection techniques rely on source code
for change identification and impact analysis. This dissertation
presents an RTS process called Integrated - Black-box Approach for
Component Change Identification (I-BACCI) for COTS-based
applications. The I-BACCI process reduces the test suite based upon
changes in the binary code of the COTS component using the firewall
analysis RTS method. This dissertation also presents Pallino, the
supporting automation that statically analyzes binary code to identify
the code change and the impact of these changes. Based on the output
of Pallino and the original test suite, testers can determine the
regression test cases needed that execute the application glue code
which is affected by the changed areas in the new version of the COTS
component.
<p>
Five case studies were conducted on ABB internal products written in
C/C++ to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the I-BACCI
process. The total size of application and component for each release
is about 340~930 KLOC. The results indicate this process can reduce
the required number of regression test by as much as 100% if there are
a small number of changes in the new component in the best
case. Similar to other RTS techniques, when there are many changes in
the new component the I-BACCI process suggests a retest-all regression
test strategy.
<p>
With the help of Pallino, RTS via the I-BACCI process can be completed
in about one to two person hours for each release of the case
studies. Depending upon the percentage of test cases reduction
determined by the I-BACCI process, the total time cost of the whole
regression testing process can be reduced to 0.0003% of that by
retest-all strategy in the best case. Currently, Pallino works on
components in Common Object File Format or Portable Executable
formats.
