<p>Build systems are a central part in modern software engineering projects and especially with the gaining popularity of development practices, such as Continuous Integration, their popularity increased as well. Software development teams use build systems to automate the process of assembling, testing, packaging, deploying, and releasing their artifacts. Consequently, the quality of the artifacts, in particular of the software artifacts, and the productivity of the developers increases due to the rapid feedback cycles that the automation allows. However, the usage of build systems entails an additional maintenance effort that the developers need to deal with because the configuration of the build system evolves over time and hence, it needs to be maintained regularly. Ignoring this need can lead to an increased probability to break the build and, consequently, costs the companies money because build breakage prevents them to ship their products instantly. In this thesis, we address the problem of broken builds and aim at minimizing the time of build breakage. We approach the problem of breaking builds from two sides. First, by supporting developers to prevent the build from failing, and second, by providing automated methods to repair already broken builds. First, we provide methods that can help to avoid breaking the build by indicating possibly faulty build configurations or missing changes to the build configuration. In particular, we present a model that can predict whether a commit misses an accompanying change to the build configuration. Our model improved the state-of-the-art model for intra- and cross-project prediction by 11.54% and 9.46%, respectively. Second, we propose methods that can automatically repair the build configuration of broken builds to allow the build to succeed again without any manual intervention from the developers. To that extent, we initially build a tool called BuildDiff that can extract changes between two consecutive versions of build configuration files. With the help of this tool, we studied these build changes and found that changes to version numbers and to dependencies are among the most frequently occurring build changes. We also found that build changes are usually not evenly distributed over the projects' time line but cluster around release days. We then use BuildDiff to study the build changes that developers make when they repair broken builds. In a first study, we could identify three repair strategies i.e., Version Update, Delete Dependency, and Add Repository, that are frequently used to resolve dependency-related build breakage. We implemented these strategies in a tool called BuildMedic to repair such build breakage. BuildMedic could repair 54% of the studied commits. In 36% of these cases the applied changes were identical to the developers' repair. In a follow-up study, we extended BuildMedic with an approach that can identify missing dependencies of a broken build. The evaluation of this approach showed that it could repair 59% of the studied commits. Among them, 28% were identical changes compared to the developers' fixes. The results of this thesis provide a substantial base to support developers in their work with build systems. Developers can stay focused on their current tasks and apply our methods to automate the maintenance of build systems.</p>
