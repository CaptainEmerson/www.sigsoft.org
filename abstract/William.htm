<div align="justify">Maintenance tends to degrade the structure of software, ultimately making
maintenance more costly.  At times, then, it is worthwhile to manipulate the
structure of a system to make changes easier.  However, it is shown that
manual restructuring is an error-prone and expensive activity.  By
separating structural manipulations from other maintenance activities, the
semantics of a system can be held constant by a tool, assuring that no
errors are introduced by restructuring.  To allow the maintenance team to
focus on the aspects of restructuring and maintenance requiring human
judgment, a transformation-based tool can be provided--based on a model
that exploits preserving data flow-dependence and control
flow-dependence--to automate the repetitive, error-prone, and
computationally demanding aspects of restructuring.  A set of automatable
transformations is introduced; their impact on structure is described, and
their usefulness is demonstrated in examples.  A model to aid building
meaning-preserving restructuring transformations is described, and its
realization in a functioning prototype tool for restructuring Scheme
programs is discussed.
