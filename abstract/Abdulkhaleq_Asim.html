However, safety is a system level property, and therefore, software safety must be considered at the system level to ensure the whole system&#8217;s safety. In fact, identifying software hazards is not enough to make software safe. The software components in the systems need also to be verified extensively against their safety requirements to ensure a high level of system safety. The complexity of software systems makes defining appropriate software safety requirements with traditional safety analysis techniques such as FTA (Fault Tree Analysis), (Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis) difficult. To cope with complex systems, a new technique called STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis)[1] based on system and control theory has been developed by Leveson. To get a better understanding about the STPA capabilities in terms of extracting software safety requirements on the system level compared to the existing safety analysis techniques, we conducted a controlled experiment to compare the application of STPA vs. FTA and FMECA quantitatively by applying these three techniques to three safety-critical software systems. The results showed that STPA seems to be an effective method to identify software safety requirements at the system level. Particularly, STPA addresses more different software safety requirements than the traditional techniques such as FTA and FEMCA, but STPA needs more time to carry out by safety analysts with little or no prior experience.</p><p>In the software development process, formal verification and functional testing are complementary approaches which are used to verify the functional correctness of software; however, even perfectly reliable software could lead to an accident. The correctness of software cannot ensure the safe operation of safety-critical software systems. Therefore, developing safety-critical software requires a more systematic software and safety engineering process that enables the software and safety engineers to recognize the potential software risks. For this purpose, this dissertation introduces a comprehensive software safety engineering approach based on STPA for Software-Intensive Systems, called STPA SwISs, which provides seamless STPA safety analysis and software safety verification activities to allow the software and safety engineers to work together during the software development for safety-critical systems and help them to recognize the associated software risks at the system level.</p><p>To explore and evaluate the application of the STPA SwISs approach, we conducted a pilot case study and two industrial case studies based on the automotive software systems. The pilot case study was conducted during the development of a prototype of a software simulator of the Adaptive Cruise Control System (ACC) with a stop-and-go function using a Lego-Mindstorms EV3 robot. The first industrial case study was conducted on the Active Cruise Control System (ACC) at the BMW Group. The second case study was conducted on the fully Automated Driving system (FADS) of autonomous vehicles at Continental. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the STPA SwISs approach and show that it is scalable and applicable to real software systems.</p><p>We also developed a safety engineering platform, called XSTAMPP to support the application of STAMP methodologies and the STPA SwISs approach to help software and safety engineers in identifying the software safety requirements, automatically verifying their design and implementation against the STPA-generated software safety requirements with model checking tools and automatically generating safety-based test cases from STPA results.</p><p>As a conclusion, we believe that the combination of STPA-based safety analysis and the safety-based software verification activities is a practical and effective way to recognize software risks and assure the quality of software. The degree of automation added a value to the proposed approach by allowing the safety and software engineers to perform seamless safety analysis, software safety verification and safety-based testing activities in one comprehensive approach. Furthermore, this dissertation opens doors for interesting opportunities in safety software engineering.</p></body></html>
