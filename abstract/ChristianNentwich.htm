In many coordinated activities documents are produced and maintained
in a distributed fashion, without the use of a single central
repository or file store. The complex relation- ships between
documents in such a setting can frequently become hard to identify and
track.
<p>
This thesis addresses the problem of managing the consistency of a set
of distributed and possibly heterogeneous documents. From the user
perspective, the process of consistency management encompasses
checking for consistency, obtaining diagnostic reports, and op-
tionally taking action to remove inconsistency. We describe an
approach to execute checks between documents and providing
diagnostics, and demonstrate its validity in a number of practical
case studies.
<p>
In order to be able to check the consistency of a set of distributed
and heterogeneous documents we must provide mechanisms to bridge the
heterogeneity gap, to organise documents, to find a way of expressing
consistency constraints and to return appropriate diagnostic
information as the result of a check. We specify a novel semantics for
a first order logic constraint language that maps constraints to
hyperlinks that connect inconsistent elements. We present an
implementation of the semantics in a working check engine, and a
supporting document management mechanism that can include
heterogeneous data sources into a check. The implementation has been
applied in a number of significant case studies and we discuss the
results of these evaluations.
<p>
As part of our practical evaluation, we have also considered the
problem of scalability.  We provide an analysis of the scalability
factors involved in consistency checking and demonstrate how each of
these factors can play a crucial role in practice. This is followed by
a discussion of a number of solutions for extending the centralised
check engine and an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses, as
well as their inherent complexities and architectural impact.
<p>
The thesis concludes with an outlook towards future work and a summary
of our contri- butions.  </div> </body> </html>
