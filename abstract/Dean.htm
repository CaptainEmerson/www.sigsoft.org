The past decade has seen an increased awareness of the challenges
involved in maintaining legacy software systems. Various reverse
engineering tools designed to assist maintainers in carrying out
software system understanding, analysis and migration tasks have been
demonstrated. While progress has been made towards increasing the
performance and usefulness of these tools, most continue to exist in
isolation, using proprietary formats, technologies and schemata to
represent the information they extract from software artifacts.
<p>
This dissertation introduces the novel idea of using specially
constructed, external tool adapters and a domain ontology to
facilitate integration among reverse engineering tools. Using a
constructive approach, we analyze software engineering tools,
identifying the many similarities they share in terms of their
architecture and the concepts they represent. Organizing these
representational concepts into a domain ontology provides the
knowledge required by specialized adapters to enable the sharing of
services among tools participating in an integration. The design for
a multi-phase methodology for sharing services among reverse
engineering tools is presented. Various issues related to this
service-sharing approach are explored. Our experiences in developing
a proof of concept implementation based on the design and the
challenges encountered are provided. We demonstrate that
service-sharing among a set of reverse engineering tools can be
accomplished by following our approach to ontology-based integration.
