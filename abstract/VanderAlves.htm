Software Product Line (SPL) is a promising approach for developing a
set of products scoped within a market segment and based on common
artifacts. Potential benefits are large scale reuse and significant
boost in productivity. An incurred key challenge, however, is
handling adoption strategies, whereby an organization decides to
start the SPL from scratch, bootstrap existing products into a SPL,
or evolve an existing SPL. In particular, at the implementation and
feature model levels, development methods lack adequate support for
extracting and evolving SPLs. In this context, we present an
original method providing concrete guidelines for extracting and
evolving SPLs at the implementation and feature model levels, at
both of which it supports reuse and safety. The method first
bootstraps the SPL and then evolves it with a reactive approach. The
method relies on a collection of provided refactorings at both the
code level (aspect-oriented refactorings) and at the feature model
level. The method was assessed in the highly variant domain of
mobile games.
