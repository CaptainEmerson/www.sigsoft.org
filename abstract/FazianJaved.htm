Grammar Inference is the process of learning a grammar from examples,
either positive (i.e., the grammar generates the string) and/or
negative (i.e., the grammar does not generate the string). Although
grammar inference has been successfully applied to many diverse
domains such as speech recognition and robotics, its application to
software engineering has been limited. This research investigates the
applicability of grammar inference to software engineering and
programming language development challenge problems, where grammar
inference offers an innovative solution to the problem, while
remaining tractable and within the scope of that
problem. Specifically, the following challenges are addressed in this
research: 
<ol>
<li> Recovery of a metamodel from instance models: Within the
area of domain-specific modeling (DSM), instance models may evolve
independently of the original metamodel resulting in metamodel drift,
an inconsistency between the instance model and the associated
metamodel such that the instance model may no longer be loaded into
the modeling tool. Although prior work has focused on the problem of
schema evolution, no previous work addresses the problem of recovering
a lost metamodel from instance models. A contribution of this research
is the MetAmodel Recovery System (MARS) that uses grammar inference in
concert with a host of complementary technologies and tools to address
the metamodel drift problem.
<li>
Recovery of domain-specific language (DSL) specifications from
example DSL programs: An open problem in DSL development is a need for
reducing the time needed to learn language development tools by
incorporating support for the description-by-example (DBE) paradigm of
language specifications like syntax. This part of the dissertation
focuses on recovering specifications of imperative, explicitly
Turing-complete and context-free DSLs. A contribution of this research
is GenInc, an unsupervised incremental CFG learning algorithm that
allows further progress towards inferring DSLs and finds a second
application in recovery of legacy DSLs.  The research described in
this dissertation makes the following contributions: i) A metamodel
recovery tool for DSM environments, ii) Easier development of DSLs for
domain experts, and iii) Advances in grammar inference algorithms that
may also have new applications in other areas of computer sciences
(e.g., bioinformatics).
