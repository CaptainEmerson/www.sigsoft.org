In this PhD dissertation we claim that the principles behind object-oriented software evolution are independent of a particular domain or phase in the software life-cycle. To validate this claim, a formalism based on graph transformation was developed and applied to a particular aspect of software evolution, namely the problem of software upgrading and software merging. When the same piece of software is modified in parallel by different software developers, unexpected inconsistencies can arise. Formal support can be provided to detect and resolve these inconsistencies in a general way.
