<p align="justify">In the last decade the increasing popularity of the World
Wide Web has lead to an exponential growth in the number of pages available on
the Web. This huge number of Web pages makes it increasingly difficult for
users to find required information. In searching the Web for specific
information, one gets lost in the vast number of irrelevant search results and
may miss relevant material. Current Web applications provide Web pages in HTML
format representing the content in natural language only and the semantics of
the content is therefore not accessible by machines. To enable machines to
support the user in solving information problems, the Semantic Web proposes an
extension to the existing Web that makes the semantics of the Web pages
machine-processable. The semantics of the information of a Web page is
formalized using RDF meta-data describing the meaning of the content. The
existence of semantically annotated Web pages is therefore crucial in bringing
the Semantic Web into!
 existence.

<p align="justify">Semantic annotation addresses this problem and aims to turn
human-understandable content into a machine-processable form by adding
semantic markup. Many tools have been developed that support the user during
the annotation process. The annotation process, however, is a separate task
and is not integrated in the Web engineering process. Web engineering proposes
methodologies to design implement and maintain Web applications but these
methodologies lack the generation of meta-data.

<p align="justify">In this thesis we introduce a technique to extend existing
XML-based Web engineering methodologies to develop semantically annotated Web
pages. The novelty of this approach is the definition of a mapping from XML
Schema to ontologies, called WEESA, that can be used to automatically generate
RDF meta-data from XML content documents. We further demonstrate the
integration of the WEESA meta-data generator into the Apache Cocoon Web
development framework to easily extend XML-based Web applications to
semantically annotated Web application.

<p align="justify">Looking at the meta-data of a single Web page gives only a
limited view of the of the information available in a Web application. For
querying and reasoning purposes it is better to have the full meta-data model
of the whole Web application as a knowledge base at hand. In this thesis we
introduce the WEESA knowledge base, which is generated at server side by
accumulating the meta-data from individual Web pages. The WEESA knowledge base
is then offered for download and querying by software agents.

<p align="justify">Finally, the Vienna International Festival industry case
study illustrates the use of WEESA within an Apache Cocoon Web application in
real life. We discuss the lessons learned while implementing the case study
and give guidelines for developing Semantic Web applications using WEESA.
