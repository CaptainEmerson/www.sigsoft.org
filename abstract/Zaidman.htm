Dynamic analysis has long been a subject of study in the context of (compiler)
optimization, program comprehension, test coverage, etc. Ever-since,
the scale of the event trace has been an important issue. This scalability
issue finds its limits on the computational front, where time and/or space
complexity of algorithms become too large to be handled by a computer, but
also on the cognitive front, where the results presented to the user become
too large to be easily understood.
This research focusses on delivering a number of dynamic analysis based
program comprehension solutions that help software engineers to focus on the
software system during their initial program exploration and comprehension
phases.
<p>
The key concepts we use in our techniques are frequency of execution
and runtime coupling. Both techniques deliver a solution which can help
the software engineer bring focus into his or her comprehension process by
annotating parts of the trace that contain similarities or by bringing out
the key concepts (classes) of a system. To validate our techniques we used
a number of open-source software systems, as well as an industrial legacy
application.
