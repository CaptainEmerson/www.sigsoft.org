Several modularity problems in software designs are related to the
inadequate modularization of key broadly-scoped concerns, such as
exception handling, distribution, and persistence. However, most of
the current quantitative assessment approaches are not sensitive to
concerns that drive the design, thereby leading to a number of
shortcomings in the modularity evaluation process. Therefore, there is
a need for measurement approaches that support a more effective
identification of modularity anomalies related to crosscutting
concerns. Also, this necessity becomes more apparent in an age that a
number of different forms of design decompositions, such as
aspect-oriented software development, are emerging. In this context,
this thesis aims at investigating a novel approach for quantitative
modularity assessment of software design by promoting the concept of
concern as a measurement abstraction. Our concern-driven measurement
approach encompasses a set of mechanisms for assessing software
modularity from architectural to detailed design. The proposed
concern-sensitive approach includes: (i) a suite of architectural
metrics, (ii) a suite of detailed design metrics, (iii) a suite of
design heuristic rules for supporting the interpretation of metrics in
meaningful ways, and (iv) a tool, called COMET, that supports both
concern-driven notation and measurement of architectural designs. We
evaluated the usefulness of our concern-oriented measurement technique
in a series of empirical studies, comparing the modularity of
conventional and aspect-oriented software design.
