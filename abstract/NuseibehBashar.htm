<p>The development of large and complex systems necessarily involves many people - each with their own perspective on the system, defined by their skills, responsibilities and expertise. This is particularly true for composite systems, that is, systems which deploy multiple component technologies. The intersections between perspectives however, are far from obvious because the knowledge within each is represented in different ways. Furthermore, because development may be carried out concurrently by those involved, different perspectives may be at different stages of elaboration, and may be subject to different development strategies. The problem of how to guide and organise systems development in this setting, we term the  multiple perspectives problem.</p>
 
<p>This thesis focuses on the specification and design of software-based systems. In particular, it addresses the problem of method integration in this setting, which is viewed as an instance of the multiple perspectives problem.</p>
 
<p>The thesis elaborates a software development framework based on loosely coupled, locally managed, distributable objects, called  ViewPoints, which encapsulate partial representation, process and specification knowledge about a system and its domain. ViewPoint templates, denoting ViewPoint types, are introduced, and are used as the building blocks of software development methods. Such methods, and the ViewPoints that are created as a result of deploying them, are integrated via pairwise inter-ViewPoint rules, which express the relationships that must hold between ViewPoints in order to achieve consistency.</p>
 
<p>The thesis proposes a model of ViewPoint interaction in which inter-ViewPoint rules are defined during method design, and invoked and applied during method deployment. Fine-grain process modelling is used as the means of providing local method guidance and of coordinating ViewPoint interaction. In the spirit of multi-perspective development, inconsistencies are tolerated and managed by prescribing rules that specify how to act in the presence of these inconsistencies.</p>
 
<p>This thesis makes a novel contribution to the organisation and management of multi-perspective software development, and illustrates the role of method engineering, process modelling and consistency management in this setting. The entire ViewPoints framework is supported by a prototype environment, The Viewer, implemented to demonstrate the scope and feasibility of the approach.</p>
