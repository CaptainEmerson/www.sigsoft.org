<div align="justify">The industry is nowadays confronted with large-scale monolithic and inflexible objectoriented software. Because of their high business value, these legacy systems must be reengineered. One of the important issues in reengineering is the detection and location of the design flaws, which prevent an efficient maintenance and further development of the system.
<P>

This thesis presents a novel metrics-based approach for detecting design problems. The approach is based on the Detection Strategy concept, which is a higher-level mechanism for interpreting measurement results. Detection strategies allow the engineer to define metrics-based rules that "quantify" design principles, rules and heuristics related to the quality of a design. 

After defining the mechanism itself, the thesis introduces a suite of detection strategies for the identification of different well-known design flaws found in the literature (e.g. Shotgun Surgery, Refused Bequest etc), but also for problems never mentioned before (e.g. omissions of design patterns). 

Eventually, the thesis defines a novel type of quality model, called Factor-Strategy. The new quality model removes the drawbacks of the well known FCM approach, allowing for the first time quality to be expressed in terms of compliance with principles, rules and heuristics of good object-oriented design. These are made quantifiable in form of different detection strategies, so that quality is associated with detection strategies, instead of being mapped to pure numbers. The main advantage of this new model is that it leads to a direct identification of the real causes of quality flaws.

In conclusion, the disseration claims that the gap between qualitative and quantitative statements, concerning object-oriented software design can be bridged using higher-level, goal-driven methods for measurement interpretation.
