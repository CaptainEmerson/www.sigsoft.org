<div align="justify">It is the thesis of this work that viewpoint resolution can be used as a means for very early validation in the process of requirements elicitation.
<P>

Requirements elicitation is the process in requirements analysis responsible for understanding, finding, and gathering information.  As a part of requirements elicitation, the objective of fact-validation is to make sure that the facts gathered reflect the original intent, as well as to help unfold the knowledge not yet recorded as facts.
<P>

Viewpoint resolution is a different approach to very early validation.  It takes place in the process of fact-validation, and is based on the acknowledgment that software requirements can be elicited from different viewpoints.
<P>

The thesis proposes a language for expressing views from diferent viewpoints and an automated static analyzer of views that is capable of differentiating between missing information an conflicting information, thus providing support for viewpoint resolution.  The thesis also presents the results of initial investigations into the effectiveness of these mechanisms for viewpoint resolution.
