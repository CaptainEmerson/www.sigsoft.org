There have been many attempts made to formalize the use cases by restructuring the use case template that makes use of certain grammatical constructions to guide the structure or the style of the description. However, the amount of formalism incorporated in the use case can have a substantial influence on the quality of the specification. In this thesis, we report on the empirical studies conducted to assess three usability aspects, namely comprehension, learnability and operability of the use cases for the software specification problems used in the study. We judged the comprehension aspect by evaluating the subjects' understanding of the requirements, specified in eight different use case templates, and the ease with which the changes were made by them in the requirement specifications. Our results suggested that a more descriptive use case template with an intermediate degree of formality is more understandable, and use case templates which tend to be more formal are more flexible to adapt to the changes. The learnability aspect was judged by assessing the completeness, the correctness, the consistency and the redundancy of the use case specifications developed by the subjects using eight different use case templates for a set of software specification problems. We found that the use case templates with a higher degree of formalism lead to enhance learnability. We evaluated the operability aspect by deriving analysis models from a set of problem specifications specified using two different templates having different degrees of formalism, and it was found that the use case templates with a higher degree of formalism led to the derivation of analysis models of higher quality. Finally, we investigated the specification completeness of the eight use case templates and identified twenty use case elements which significantly contributed towards the completeness of the problem specifications used in the study.</p></body></html>
