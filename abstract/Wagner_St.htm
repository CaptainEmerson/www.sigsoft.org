Analytical software quality assurance (SQA) constitutes a significant part of the total development costs of a software system. Most estimates say that about 50% of the costs can be attributed to defect-detection and removal. Hence, this is a promising area for cost-optimisation. Various defect-detection techniques can be used to improve the quality of software. Those techniques differ in many respects and it is consolidated knowledge that the best result in terms of defect-detection can be obtained by combining several diverse techniques.
The main question in that context is then how to use those different techniques in a cost-optimal way. In detail, this boils down to the questions (1) which techniques to use, (2) in which order, (3) with how much effort, and (4) with which distribution over the components. The major problem stated by several authors is that the costs and benefits of SQA and the interrelationships of the infuencing factors are still not totally
understood.<p>
The main contribution of this dissertation is an analytical and stochastic model of the economics of analytical SQA, based on expected values. The model is more general than existing analytical models, as it is able to handle different types of techniques, i.e., static and dynamic ones. Nevertheless, the proposed model is more concrete than comparable economic models of QA because it includes the technical factors that influence defect detection. The model can be used (1) to analyse different techniques theoretically and (2) to optimise the SQA in a company using historical project data. Relevant data for the model is collected from the literature to give average values for different techniques and defects. This allows an easier application of the model in practice. Based on the empirical data the model is subject to sensitivity analysis resulting in a quantitative order of importance of the input factors. This allows to determine which factors are most beneficial to be analysed in more detail.
Finally, an approach to identify defect-prone components of a system based on measures of detailed design models allows to concentrate the SQA on these components. It thereby improves the effciency of defect-detection.<p>
The approach for cost-optimisation of SQA is calibrated using several case studies. A complete validation was not feasible because the model needs calibration over several projects in a company to yield reasonable predictions. The largest case study is an evaluation of model-based testing in an industrial project in which the network controller of an automotive network was tested. Further studies were done in various domains and evaluating different techniques in different phases. All these case studies provided  valuable feedback on the model and also contributed to the body of knowledge on the efficiency of the techniques.
