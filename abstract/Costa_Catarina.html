A common practice to manage parallel development is the use of branches. Eventually, these branches need to be reintegrated through a merge operation. In this process, if conflicts arise, the developers need to communicate to reach consensus about the desired resolution. The developers must ensure that the result complies with the objective of the work, and that there is no high-level conflict (syntactic and semantic), as these conflicts are more difficult to identify automatically. For this reason, inviting the right developers to a collaborative merge session is fundamental. However, this task can be difficult especially when many different developers have made significant changes on each branch over a large number of files. The main goal of this work is to present TIPMerge, an approach conceived to recommend participants for collaborative merge sessions. TIPMerge analyzes the project history and builds a ranked list of developers who are the most appropriate to integrate a pair of branches, considering their changes in the branches, in the previous history, and the dependencies among files across branches. Our results show an average normalized improvement of 15.14% (median 25.01%) for top-1 and 43.45% (median 51.66%) for top-3 of the ranking compared to the majority classes, i.e., developers who performed most merges. Although useful for choosing a specific developer to perform the merge, usually picking the top developers in such ranking is not effective for collaborative merge sessions, as the top developers may have overlapping knowledge due to changes over the same files. In order to support collaborative merge, TIPMerge employs optimization techniques to choose developers with complementary knowledge, aiming at maximizing the joint knowledge coverage. Our results show an average normalized improvement of 47.31% (median 48.48%) for the joint knowledge coverage when using the optimization techniques employed by TIPMerge for assembling teams of three developers for collaborative merge in comparison to choosing the top-3 developers in the ranked list.</p></body></html>
