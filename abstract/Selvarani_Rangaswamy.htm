<p>The rapid transformation, taking place in the field of Information Technology through the increased performance capability of processors and the deeper understanding of the methodology of creating software has paved the way for developing innovative approaches in creating quality software.  This makes a clarion call for inventions and methods that can generate more reusable, reliable, easily maintainable and high quality defect free software system with deeper control on software development process.  The design quality metrics in object oriented paradigm offer an excellent opportunity to deal with the above cited external properties of object oriented software design. In this thesis the innovative approaches and methods required to accomplish these goals are presented. The software quality control at the design phase is a promising approach for realizing cost effective high quality final product.  In this context the estimation of external quality attributes of software at design stage based on the internal structural properties was remaining as a challenge for a long time.</p>

<p>This thesis proposes a novel estimation model for the prediction of object oriented software design quality by estimating the external qualities of the software at design level using metrics, governing the design architecture. These models are generated based on the empirical analysis carried out on internal structural properties of software with industry data and advanced regression methods are used to capture the properties of functional relationship between the entities like the software metric parameters and the levels of quality attributes.</p>

<p>The main contribution of this work is the introduction of the methods to estimate the external quality factors such as reusability, maintainability and defect proneness of object oriented software system. These estimations can be carried out at the end phase of the design process and the model represents a linear combination of estimation equations involving metric parameters. These predictions are based on the structural properties involving multiple parameters which have intricate relationships identified through various observations available till now and the current studies carried out now. This research provides Integrated Estimation models for prediction of the external quality factors of object oriented software package using metrics governing the design architecture to the industry for effective quality measurement.</p>

<p>The next contribution is the pragmatic evaluation of the design property through a holistic evaluation using the concept of entropy.  The motivation to use this metric has evolved from the data of existence of inherently high correlation between design quality metrics and software disorderliness. Shannon's entropy theorem based on information theory was applied in this context and an algorithm that defined the upper, middle and lower bounds of metric values of the software system was also proposed. This algorithm was applied on three design metrics such as RFC, WMC and CBO which are having high influence on external design quality of the system. To demonstrate this, we successfully applied it in two sampled commercial projects. The prediction results are accurate, useful and provide an effective guideline for three major desirable external qualities to the design architect to modify the design work according to the requirements of the stakeholders at an early stage of the software development life cycle.</p>
