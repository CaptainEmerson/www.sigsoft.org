<h2>Introducing the ACM SIGSOFT Blog</h2>
<p> We are excited to launch this <a href="https://sigsoft.medium.com/welcome-to-the-acm-sigsoft-blog-eca1948f79d4">blog</a>, as a way to enhance the communication between the SIGSOFT EC and the software engineering community, create a sense of community within SIGSOFT, and publicise software engineering and SIGSOFT activities to the outside world.</p>

<h2>ACM and SIGSOFT Stand with Those Who Promote Inclusivity</h2>
<p>In the United States, and throughout many regions around the world, current events have brought attention to the urgent need for equality and respect for all individuals. ACM reaffirms its commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion within the global computer science community.</p>
<p>As an international organization of nearly 100,000 professionals, ACM respects the essential worth of all people and firmly believes that diversity strengthens the scientific enterprise and society as a whole. ACMâ€™s Code of Professional Ethics embodies these principles, and our Diversity and Inclusion Council works to translate them into effective action.</p>
<p>ACM is committed to creating an environment that welcomes new ideas and perspectives, and where hostility or other harmful behaviors are not tolerated. As an organization, we stand with those who promote inclusivity.</p>
