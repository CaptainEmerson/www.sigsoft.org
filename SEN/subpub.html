<p>This page gives an overview of the submission and publication guidelines.
Please also refer to the full 
<a href="ACM_SIGSOFT_SEN_Publication_Terms_and_Conditions.pdf">SEN Publication Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<div align="center"><p><b>SEN submissions are now being accepted at <a href="http://sen.sigsoft.org/">http://sen.sigsoft.org/</a>.</b></p></div>

<h4>Publication Guidelines</h4>
<p>
Material for publication in <strong>Software Engineering Notes (SEN)</strong>
should be submitted via
<a href="http://sen.sigsoft.org/">http://sen.sigsoft.org/</a>.</p>

<p>The site allows submission of articles, reports, reviews, columns,
announcements and book reviews.</p>

<p>Under the rubric 'articles' the submission of scientific/research articles is restricted to articles that are part of a workshop for which SEN has agreed to be the publisher. Other scientific/research articles, i.e., articles that are sent unsolicited and could have been submitted to a regular journal or workshop for review will no longer be published in SEN.</p>

<p>Under the rubric 'column', we welcome contributions that discuss topics of interest among SIGSOFT members and the software engineering community at large. Columns should normally not be longer than 4 pages (exceptions may be allowed on a case-by-case basis) and trigger further discussion among community members.</p>

<p>Under the rubric 'reports' we welcome summary reports from workshops conducted under the umbrella of ICSE, ASE, ESEC/FSE and other major SIGSOFT sponsored conferences.</p>

<p>Any common file format is allowed.</p>

<p>The following templates are available:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="ACM_SIGSOFT_pubform.doc">.doc</a>: MS Word 97-2003</li>
 <li><a href="ACM_SIGSOFT_pubform.docx">.docx</a>: MS Word 2007</a></li>
 <li><a href="acm_sen_article.cls">.cls</a>: <!-- span style="font-family:cmr10,'Latin Modern Roman',serif">T<span style="vertical-align:-0.5ex;margin-left:-0.1667em;margin-right:-0.125em;text-transform:uppercase">e</span>X</span> / -->L<span style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 70%; margin-left: -0.36em; vertical-align: 0.3em; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.15em">a</span>T<span style="text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -0.1667em; vertical-align: -0.5ex; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.125em">e</span>X</li>
</ul>
<p>CFPs and Advanced Programs for SIGSoft-sponsored or in-cooperation events
may be submitted as .pdf files with all fonts embedded.</p>

<p>Because only the abstracts of papers and reports will appear in the print
issue of SEN, authors should review their abstract to make sure it reflects
the key points addressed in the document, which will appear in full in the
ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>By submitting your article for distribution in this Special Interest Group
publication, you hereby grant to ACM the following non-exclusive, perpetual,
worldwide rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>to publish in print on condition of acceptance by the editor</li>
<li>to digitize and post your article in the electronic version of this
publication</li>
<li>to include the article in the ACM Digital Library</li>
<li>to allow users to copy and distribute the article for non-commercial,
educational or research purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>However, as a contributing author, you retain copyright to your article and
ACM will make every effort to refer requests for commercial use directly to
you.</p>

<p>Letters, abstracts, book reviews, specialized bibliographies, notices, news
reports, etc., are all welcome.
All contributions are considered personal rather than organizational;
technical contributions are considered as unrefereed working papers.
Controversy is encouraged, but personal attacks are not.</p>

<h4>On Plagiarism</h4>

<p>Please see the ACM webpage about <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">plagiarism and self-plagiarism</a>.</p>

<p>Plagiarism is copying words from another published paper (your own or someone else's) without proper quotes and citations. In writing, everything not quoted and cited is presumed to be new work by the author. Plagiarism disrespects both the original author (whose contributions are not acknowledged) and the reader (who is mislead about the contributions of the current paper, and will not know where to go when they want to learn more).  It looks like theft of words or ideas.</p>

<p>Most reasons to copy text boil down to laziness. The words are already there, so copying may seem like a shortcut for anyone who is in a hurry and can't or won't put in the effort to create new words and ideas.  Everyone who struggles to express themselves clearly may thinks that copying is a shortcut.  As a rule, plagiarism indicates mediocre efforts and results.</p>

<p>So, let's go back to the real reasons for writing a technical paper.  Research and technical writing are about creating and expressing new ideas. Copying repeats old ideas, which is the opposite of creativity and innovation. If something has already been published, then simply reference it and move on.</p>

<p>You should copy when you want to comment on another author's words, for example to agree or disagree, or to show that you admire a piece of text. In these cases, the new information is why you are copying and the original and new text should be clear. In the following two examples, the original authors can speak for themselves, and by using quotes, the reader knows which ideas are mine and which are not.</p>

<ul>
 <li>"Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend, inside of a dog, it's too dark to read," is my favorite joke by Groucho Marx, even though my friends who like cats don't understand.</li>
 <li>The IEEE defines software engineering as "the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software." In our experience, most of what we do is not "quantifiable" because requirements and estimates are too often wrong. Furthermore the last six words are a non-sequitur, since defining engineering as "a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach" to anything implies that following any process is engineering, which demeans the term.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any copied text longer than a few words should be put in quotes and given a reference. If you copy more than a full sentence, use indented paragraphs to denote a block quote.  Note that copying text and then changing words here and there is not good enough. Use quotes or rewrite completely.</p>

<p>There are many places where copying is fine. Nobody worries about two or three words. Nobody worries about facts that are commonly known. "The U.N. is headquartered in New York." This sentence is true, and there are not very many ways to write it. And of course, there are occasional coincidences.  Beyond that, do not copy text.</p>

<p>Plagiarism is not a game. More than one person has written a paper and then tried to republish it a second time. That is a waste of time and effort for the editors and readers. Journals are filled with papers that nobody will ever read and plagiarism just makes this situation worse.  Just move on and write something new.</p>

<h4>Submission Deadlines</h4>

<p>SEN appears quarterly (four issues a year).
Please check with the <a href="mailto:editors_SIGSOFT@acm.org">editor</a>
for details on conference issues if you have a concern about the timeliness
of a CFP or other contribution appearing in SEN.</p>

<p>Submission deadlines are 7 weeks before publication date or roughly:</p>

<ul>
<li>November 1 for the January issue</li>
<li>February 1 for the April issue</li>
<li>May 1 for the July issue</li>
<li>August 1 for the October issue</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: SEN is transitioning to an all-electronic production process. It is
anticipated that the production schedule may shorten to 4 weeks, in which
case, the production schedule may allow additional time for late
submissions.  Please check with the editor if there are any questions on
meeting the submission deadline.</p>
