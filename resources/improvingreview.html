<h1>The ACM SIGSOFT Improving Paper and Peer Review Quality Initiative</h1>
<p>In May 2019, ACM SIGSOFT launched an initiative to improve the quality of research papers and peer reviews at software engineering venues. The initiative is co-chaired by <a href="http://paulralph.name/">Paul Ralph</a> (Dalhousie University) and <a href="https://www.inf.unibz.it/~rrobbes/">Romain Robbes</a> (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano).</p>
<p>The Initiative seeks to improve the quality of papers and peer reviews by generating and evolving <i>empirical standards</i>: brief, public documents that describe expectations for a certain kind of study. These standards are not vague criteria like "soundness" and "presentation." They list specific practices like random assignment (for experiments) and reference snowballing (for systematic reviews).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards">Preliminary standards</a> were announced in October 2020. All active researchers are encouraged to review the standards relevant to their research programs and report any potential problems or oversights by <a href="https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/issues">submitting an issue to the GitHub repo</a>. More standards are in development. To volunteer to contribute, <a href="mailto:paul@paulralph.name?subject=Contributing%20to%20Empirical%20Standards">contact Paul Ralph</a>. You do not have to be a member of ACM or SIGSOFT to report an issue or contribute to the standards.</p>
<p>A detailed report, explaining how the standards were generated and how they should be used is also available from <a href="https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards">the repo</a>.</p>
<p>Any scholarly venue can adopt these standards. Representatives of journals, conferences or other venues who would like to explore adopting the standards should <a href="mailto:paul@paulralph.name?subject=Adopting%20empirical%20standards">contact us directly</a>.</p>
