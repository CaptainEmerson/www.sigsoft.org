</ul>

<a name="grad"></a>
<h2>CAPS Funds to Support Graduate Students Travel</h2>
<p>The SIGSOFT-CAPS program provides financial assistance to students to help defray costs of attending SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences and workshops. Attendance at conferences and workshops to present papers and to interact with researchers and practitioners in software engineering is an important component of students' education and professional development. Moreover, students' presence at conferences and workshops enriches and broadens conference and workshop activities. Conferences and workshops are also a good way to introduce students to the services of SIGSOFT.</p>
<h3>What can SIGSOFT CAPS funds pay for?</h3>
<p>The funds can be used to assist with expenses incurred attending a conference or workshop that is sponsored or co-sponsored by SIGSOFT. The funds can only be used to pay for:</p>
<ul>
 <li>travel expenses to and from the conference or workshop</li>
 <li>hotel expenses at the conference or workshop</li>
 <li>conference or workshop registration</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that SIGSOFT CAPS funds have a limited budget and there are many qualified students. As a result, SIGSOFT CAPS can provide only partial support for attendance. The student's college or university, department, and/or research advisor is expected to also assist in paying the student's expenses.</p>
<p>The applicants must apply either for a <b>Merit-based award</b> or a <b>Need-based award</b>. For each conference or workshop, funds are designated to both categories.  Merit-based applicants generally can obtain necessary funds to attend the conference through their advisor/grants/department/etc, while need-based applicants may not be able to attend the conference without CAPS support.</p>
<p>Please note that it is important to provide an accurate estimation of the expenses and the available funds in various categories.</p>
<p>Common ways to reduce expenses are to buy airplane tickets early, to register for the conference early, and to share a room and/or seek out a cheaper hotel alternative than the conference hotel.</p>
<p><b>To be eligible to receive SIGSOFT CAPS funds, all the following must be true:</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>The applicant must be enrolled in a M.S. or Ph.D. program.</li>
 <li>The applicant must be a member of SIGSOFT.</li>
 <li>The conference or workshop must be sponsored or co-sponsored by SIGSOFT.</li>
 <li>An applicant is eligible for only one CAPS award per calendar year.  Preference will be given to applicants who have not received more than one other CAPS award in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To apply for SIGSOFT CAPS funds, the student must submit the following:</b></p>
<ol>
 <li>A resume (should list the paper that is being presented at the conference/workshop)</li>
 <li>A completed <a href="https://awards.sigsoft.org/CAPS/">application form</a> including a budget</li>
 <li>A <i>brief</i> note from the student's advisor or department chair supporting the application</li>
 <li>Confirmation of SIGSOFT membership including the dates (a receipt or a screenshot of your myACM/My Services page)</li>
</ol>

<p>For most conferences, the deadline for CAPS applications is two weeks before the early registration deadline, to ensure the early registration option for those who receive CAPS funding.  We highly recommend checking the conference web site for information about the early registration and CAPS applications deadlines.</p>

<h2>CAPS Funds to Support Undergraduate Students Travel</h2>
<p>SIGSOFT is pleased to provide funds to support undergraduate students to attend a SIGSOFT-sponsored event. Our goal is to provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to experience attending a software engineering conference and become familiar with the state of research and practice in the discipline. The travel grants provide <b>partial</b> coverage of expenses related to registration and travel. It is expected that the students will obtain additional funds from other sources (such as the department, college, or other scholarships).  Note that undergraduate students are <b>not required to be an author or be presenting a paper</b> at the conference. Furthermore, undergraduate students are <b>not required to be SIGSOFT members</b>. (To be eligible for reduced conference registration fees students are asked to <a href="/join.html">become a SIGSOFT member</a> for a small annual fee, after their CAPS award has been confirmed).</p>

<p><b>To be eligible to receive SIGSOFT CAPS funds, all the following must be true:</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>The applicant must be enrolled in an undergraduate program in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related discipline.</li>
 <li>The conference or workshop must be sponsored or co-sponsored by SIGSOFT.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To apply for SIGSOFT CAPS funds, the student must submit the following:</b></p>
<ol>
 <li>A resume</li>
 <li>A statement describing their interest in attending the specific event and how the CAPS travel support can help</li>
 <li>A completed <a href="https://awards.sigsoft.org/CAPS/">application form</a> including a budget</li>
 <li>A <i>brief</i> note from the student's academic advisor, the department chair, or a faculty supporting the application.</li>
 <li>Confirmation of SIGSOFT membership including the dates (a receipt or a screenshot of your myACM/My Services page).</li>
</ol>

<p>For most conferences, the deadline for CAPS applications is two weeks before the early registration deadline, to ensure the early registration option for those who receive CAPS funding.  We highly recommend checking the conference web site for information about the early registration and CAPS applications deadlines.</p>

<h2>CAPS Funds for Childcare Support</h2>
<p>SIGSOFT provides funds for a limited number of grants that support child care for both student and professional members that would like to participate in a SIGSOFT-sponsored event but are unable to do so without this support. SIGSOFT's financial assistance helps to defray the cost of a variety of child-care options:</p>
<ul>
 <li>On-site child care at conferences arranged by the parent, including placing kids in a shared care facility or paying for babysitting expenses</li>
 <li>Travel costs for a companion who provides child care, specifically for non-shared transportation costs such as airfare</li>
 <li>Travel costs for children between the ages of two and sixteen</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to limited availability of funds, there is a cap of $800 for Childcare Travel Support requests.</p>
<p>To apply for support, you must use the CAPS web portal.  Email applications are no longer accepted.  Go to the <a href="https://awards.sigsoft.org/CAPS/">CAPS portal</a> and use the option "CAPS-ChildCare".</p>

<p>For most conferences, the deadline for CAPS applications is two weeks before the early registration deadline, to ensure the early registration option for those who receive CAPS funding.  We highly recommend checking the conference web site for information about the early registration and CAPS applications deadlines.</p>
