<p>We respect the privacy of our subscribers. All email addresses are registered privately to the list; they are neither published nor otherwise distributed.</p>

<a name="contribute"></a>
<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>To contribute to SEWORLD, send an email containing your posting to <a href="mailto:seworld@sigsoft.org" title="seworld">seworld@sigsoft.org</a>.</p>

<p>Only list subscribers may post to SEWORLD.</p>

<p>Contributors are encouraged to consider these <a href="seworldguidelines.html"><b>guidelines</b></a> regarding submissions.  They are meant both to help focus the list and to ease the duties of the moderator. They are in no way meant to discourage contribution.</p>

<p>All submissions are reviewed prior to posting. Please refer to <a href="#moderation">Moderation of Contributions</a> for information about the delay and possible modifications to your submission that you can expect.</p>

<p>If your submission is posted, you will not receive individual confirmation (other than by receiving your submission as a subscriber to the list, or by monitoring the archive).</p>

<p>If your submission is not posted, you will receive a response explaining why the moderator returned your submission. Spam will be rejected outright and will not be acknowledged.</p>

<a name="moderation"></a>
<h2>Moderation of Contributions</h2>
<p>In order to avoid spam, duplication, and other misuses, a moderator reviews all submissions prior to posting. Thus, submissions will not be posted to the list immediately. Because of the moderation process, it can be <b>several days</b> before an email goes out on the list. This is particularly true because there is a maximum number of emails that can go out on the list on any particular day.</p>

<p>Further, the moderator reserves the right to modify a submission without notice or permission in order to remove extraneous information not relevant to the content of the submission (such as apologies for multiple announcements) or to alter the subject field to better reflect the content of the submission (such as modifying "Call for Papers" to include a conference name).</p>

<p>Please note that the moderator is human and may make an occasional mistake. If you feel a returned submission should still be posted, polite arguments are welcome. If you feel a submission should not have been posted, please inform the moderator by sending an email to <a href="mailto:seworld-moderator@sigsoft.org">seworld-moderator@sigsoft.org</a>.</p>

<p>All submissions are individually evaluated for posting, and every effort is made on the part of the moderator to exercise fair and impartial judgement.</p>

<p>Please understand that SEWORLD cannot assume responsibility for responding to inquiries regarding the content of particular submissions. For questions regarding a particular submission, individuals are encouraged to use the contact information provided in the submission, or to contact the contributor of the submission.</p>

<p>We respect the privacy of our subscribers. All email addresses are registered privately to the list; they are neither published nor otherwise distributed. Consequently, we cannot honor requests for information pertaining to our subscribers.</p>
