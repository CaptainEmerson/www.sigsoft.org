       <h1>Research Highlights</h1>
       <p>Starting in 2020, SIGSOFT is selecting papers from its sponsored conferences that show recent, significant, and exciting results that are also of general interest to the computer science research community. These papers, called <strong>SIGSOFT Research Highlights</strong>, are also recommended for consideration for the <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/about-communications/author-center/author-guidelines/about-research-highlights/">Research Highlights section</a> of the <a href="https://cacm.acm.org">Communications of the ACM</a>.</p>

       <h2>Nomination Process</h2>

       <p>The committee considers nominated papers from two sources:</p>

       <ul>
         <li><strong>Conference Organizers:</strong> The chair of the SIGSOFT Research Highlights Committee will solicit nominations from the program chairs of SIGSOFT-sponsored conferences.</li>
	 <li><strong>Community:</strong> Any SIGSOFT member may nominate a paper appearing in a SIGSOFT conference, provided they do not have a <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">conflict of interest</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To nominate a paper, please fill in <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cZYxzedSaEqvqfz4-J8J6rl3q4pHT1JHiS3Dx-uvXptURFo3WDRGTFUxNFFHREVSUEE2NTcwWUdDRy4u">the nomination form</a>.</p>
      
      <p><i>By submitting a nomination statement, nominators authorize the SIGSOFT Research Highlights Committee to reuse all or a portion of the statement for the purpose of nominating the paper further as a CACM Research Highlight, if applicable.</i></p>

      	<p class="highlight-paper-statement"><strong>Nomination Statement: </strong> Cognitive biases impact decision-making in many spheres of human activity, including software development. If left unchecked, cognitive biases can lead to negative outcomes which, in the case of software development, include inferior solutions and the need to reverse design decisions later in the development process. This paper presents the first field study of the effects of cognitive biases in software development. In contrast to prior work which was conducted in controlled environments, this study analyzed data primarily collected from software developers' daily work. The study offers a rich perspective on how cognitive biases manifest themselves in practice with insights for many stakeholders, including developers, their managers, and the builders of software development tools. These insights for improving software development tools and practices also have the potential to apply more broadly to the use of software technology in general.</p>
